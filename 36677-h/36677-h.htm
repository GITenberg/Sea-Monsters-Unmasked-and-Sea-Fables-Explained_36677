<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>As I commence this little history of two sea monsters
there comes to my mind a remark made to me by my
friend, Mr. Samuel L. Clemens&mdash;"Mark Twain"&mdash;which
illustrates a feeling that many a writer must have
experienced when dealing with a subject that has been
previously well handled. Expressing to me one day the
gratification he felt in having made many pleasant
acquaintances in England, he added, with dry humour,
and a grave countenance, "Yes! I owe your countrymen
no grudge or ill-will. I freely forgive them, though one
of them did me a grievous wrong, an irreparable injury!
It was Shakspeare: if he had not written those plays of
his, I should have done so! They contain <i>my</i> thoughts,
<i>my</i> sentiments! He forestalled me!"</p>

<p>In treating of the so-called "sea-serpent," I have been
anticipated by many able writers. Mr. Gosse, in his
delightful book, 'The Romance of Natural History,'
published in 1862, devoted a chapter to it; and numerous
articles concerning it have appeared in various papers and
periodicals.</p>

<p>But, for the information from which those authors have
drawn their inferences, and on which they have founded
their opinions, they have been greatly indebted, as must
be all who have seriously to consider this subject, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
late experienced editor of the <i>Zoologist</i>, Mr. Edward
Newman, a man of wonderful power of mind, of great
judgment, a profound thinker, and an able writer. At a
time when, as he said, "the shafts of ridicule were launched
against believers and unbelievers in the sea-serpent in a
very pleasing and impartial manner," he, in the true spirit
of philosophical inquiry, in 1847, opened the columns of
his magazine to correspondence on this topic, and all the
more recent reports of marine monsters having been seen
are therein recorded. To him, therefore, the fullest
acknowledgments are due.</p>

<p>The great cuttles, also, have been the subject of articles
in various magazines, notably one by Mr. W. Saville
Kent, F.L.S., in the 'Popular Science Review' of April,
1874, and a chapter in my little book on the Octopus,
published in 1873, is also devoted to them. In writing
of them as the living representatives of the kraken, and as
having been frequently mistaken for the "sea-serpent,"
my deductions have been drawn from personal knowledge,
and an intimate acquaintance with the habits, form, and
structure of the animals described. It was only by
watching the movements of specimens of the "common
squid" (<i>Loligo vulgaris</i>), and the "little squid" (<i>L. media</i>),
which lived in the tanks of the Brighton Aquarium, that
I recognised in their peculiar habit of occasionally
swimming half-submerged, with uplifted caudal extremity,
and trailing arms, the fact that I had before me the "sea-serpent"
of many a well-authenticated anecdote. A mere
knowledge of their form and anatomy after death had
never suggested to me that which became at once apparent
when I saw them in life.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to me to acknowledge gratefully the
kindness I have met with in connection with the illustrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
of this book. The proprietors of the <i>Illustrated
London News</i> not only gave me permission to copy, in
reduced size, their two pictures of the <i>D&aelig;dalus</i> incident,
but presented to me electrotype copies of all others small
enough for these pages&mdash;namely, "Jonah and the Monster,"
Egede's "Sea-Serpent," and the Whale as seen from the
<i>Pauline</i>. Equally kind have been the proprietors of the
<i>Field</i>. To them I am greatly indebted for their permission
to copy the beautiful woodcuts of the "Octopus at Rest,"
"The Sepia seizing its Prey," and the arms of the Newfoundland
squids, and also for "electros" of the two curious
Japanese engravings, all of which originally appeared
in their paper. From the <i>Graphic</i> I have had similar
permission to copy any cuts that might be thought
suitable, and the illustrations of the sea-serpent, as seen
from Her Majesty's yacht <i>Osborne</i> and the <i>City of Baltimore</i>,
are from that journal. Messrs. Nisbet most courteously
allowed me to have a copy of the block of the <i>Enaliosaurus</i>
swimming, which was one of the numerous pictures in
Mr. Gosse's book, published by them, already referred to.
And last, not least, I have to thank Miss Ellen Woodward,
daughter of my friend, Dr. Henry Woodward, F.R.S., for
enabling me to better explain the movements and appearances
of the squids when swimming, and when raising their
bodies out of water in an erect position, by carefully
drawing them from my rough sketches.</p>

<h2>THE KRAKEN.</h2>


<p>In the legends and traditions of northern nations, stories of
the existence of a marine animal of such enormous size
that it more resembled an island than an organised being
frequently found a place. It is thus described in an
ancient manuscript (about <small>A.D.</small> 1180), attributed to the
Norwegian King Sverre; and the belief in it has been
alluded to by other Scandinavian writers from an early
period to the present day. It was an obscure and
mysterious sea-monster, known as the Kraken, whose form
and nature were imperfectly understood, and it was peculiarly
the object of popular wonder and superstitious
dread.</p>

<p>Eric Pontoppidan, the younger, Bishop of Bergen, and
member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Copenhagen,
is generally, but unjustly, regarded as the inventor of the
semi-fabulous Kraken, and is constantly misquoted by
authors who have never read his work,<a name="Anchor_1_1" id="Anchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">&nbsp;[1]&nbsp;</a> and who, one after
another, have copied from their predecessors erroneous statements
concerning him. More than half a century before him,
Christian Francis Paullinus,<a name="Anchor_2_2" id="Anchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">&nbsp;[2]&nbsp;</a> a physician and naturalist of
Eisenach, who evinced in his writings an admiration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>the marvellous rather than of the useful, had described
as resembling Gesner's 'Heracleoticon,' a monstrous animal
which occasionally rose from the sea on the coasts of
Lapland and Finmark, and which was of such enormous
dimensions, that a regiment of soldiers could conveniently
man&oelig;uvre on its back. About the same date, but a little
earlier, Bartholinus, a learned Dane, told how, on a certain
occasion, the Bishop of Midaros found the Kraken quietly
reposing on the shore, and mistaking the enormous creature
for a huge rock, erected an altar upon it and performed
mass. The Kraken respectfully waited till the ceremony
was concluded, and the reverend prelate safe on shore, and
then sank beneath the waves.</p>

<p>And a hundred and fifty years before Bartholinus and
Paullinus wrote, Olaus Magnus,<a name="Anchor_3_3" id="Anchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">&nbsp;[3]&nbsp;</a> Archbishop of Upsala, in
Sweden, had related many wondrous narratives of sea-monsters,&mdash;tales
which had gathered and accumulated
marvels as they had been passed on from generation to
generation in oral history, and which he took care to bequeath
to his successors undeprived of any of their fascination.
According to him, the Kraken was not so polite to
the laity as to the Bishop, for when some fishermen lighted
a fire on its back, it sank beneath their feet, and overwhelmed
them in the waters.</p>

<p>Pontoppidan was not a fabricator of falsehoods; but, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>collecting evidence relating to the "great beasts" living in
"the great and wide sea," was influenced, as he tells us, by
"a desire to extend the popular knowledge of the glorious
works of a beneficent Creator." He gave too much
credence to contemporary narratives and old traditions of
floating islands and sea monsters, and to the superstitious
beliefs and exaggerated statements of ignorant fishermen:
but if those who ridicule him had lived in his day and amongst
his people, they would probably have done the same; for
even Linn&aelig;us was led to believe in the Kraken, and catalogued
it in the first edition of his 'Systema Natur&aelig;,' as
'<i>Sepia Microcosmos</i>.' He seems to have afterwards had
cause to discredit his information respecting it, for he
omitted it in the next edition. The Norwegian bishop was
a conscientious and painstaking investigator, and the tone of
his writings is neither that of an intentional deceiver nor of
an incautious dupe. He diligently endeavoured to separate
the truth from the cloud of error and fiction by which it
was obscured; and in this he was to a great extent successful,
for he correctly identifies, from the vague and perplexing
descriptions submitted to him, the animal whose habits
and structure had given rise to so many terror-laden
narratives and extravagant traditions.</p>

<p>The following are some of his remarks on the subject of
this gigantic and ill-defined animal. Although I have
greatly abbreviated them, I have thought it right to quote
them at considerable length, that the modest and candid
spirit in which they were written may be understood:<a name="Anchor_4_4" id="Anchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">&nbsp;[4]&nbsp;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>"Amongst the many things," he says, "which are in the ocean,
and concealed from our eyes, or only presented to our view for a
few minutes, is the Kraken. This creature is the largest and most
surprising of all the animal creation, and consequently well deserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
such an account as the nature of the thing, according to
the Creator's wise ordinances, will admit of. Such I shall give at
present, and perhaps much greater light on this subject may be
reserved for posterity.</p>

<p>"Our fishermen unanimously affirm, and without the least
variation in their accounts, that when they row out several miles to
sea, particularly in the hot summer days, and by their situation
(which they know by taking a view of different points of land)
expect to find eighty or a hundred fathoms of water, it often
happens that they do not find above twenty or thirty, and sometimes
less. At these places they generally find the greatest plenty
of fish, especially cod and ling. Their lines, they say, are no
sooner out than they may draw them up with the hooks all full of
fish. By this they know that the Kraken is at the bottom. They
say this creature causes those unnatural shallows mentioned above,
and prevents their sounding. These the fishermen are always glad
to find, looking upon them as a means of their taking abundance
of fish. There are sometimes twenty boats or more got together
and throwing out their lines at a moderate distance from each
other; and the only thing they then have to observe is whether
the depth continues the same, which they know by their lines, or
whether it grows shallower, by their seeming to have less water.
If this last be the case they know that the Kraken is raising himself
nearer the surface, and then it is not time for them to stay any longer;
they immediately leave off fishing, take to their oars, and get away
as fast as they can. When they have reached the usual depth of
the place, and find themselves out of danger, they lie upon their
oars, and in a few minutes after they see this enormous monster
come up to the surface of the water; he there shows himself sufficiently,
though his whole body does not appear, which, in all
likelihood, no human eye ever beheld. Its back or upper part,
which seems to be in appearance about an English mile and a
half in circumference (some say more, but I chuse the least for
greater certainty), looks at first like a number of small islands surrounded
with something that floats and fluctuates like sea-weeds.
Here and there a larger rising is observed like sand-banks, on
which various kinds of small fishes are seen continually leaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
about till they roll off into the water from the sides of it; at last
several bright points or horns appear, which grow thicker and
thicker the higher they rise above the surface of the water, and
sometimes they stand up as high and as large as the masts of
middle-sized vessels. It seems these are the creature's arms, and
it is said if they were to lay hold of the largest man of war they
would pull it down to the bottom. After this monster has been
on the surface of the water a short time it begins slowly to sink
again, and then the danger is as great as before; because the
motion of his sinking causes such a swell in the sea, and such an
eddy or whirlpool, that it draws everything down with it, like the
current of the river Male.</p>

<p>"As this enormous sea-animal in all probability may be reckoned
of the Polype, or of the Starfish kind, as shall hereafter be
more fully proved, it seems that the parts which are seen rising at
its pleasure, and are called arms, are properly the tentacula, or
feeling instruments, called horns, as well as arms. With these they
move themselves, and likewise gather in their food.</p>

<p>"Besides these, for this last purpose the great Creator has also
given this creature a strong and peculiar scent, which it can emit
at certain times, and by means of which it beguiles and draws
other fish to come in heaps about it. This animal has another
strange property, known by the experience of many old fishermen.
They observe that for some months the Kraken or Krabben is
continually eating, and in other months he always voids his excrements.
During this evacuation the surface of the water is coloured
with the excrement, and appears quite thick and turbid. This
muddiness is said to be so very agreeable to the smell or taste of
other fishes, or to both, that they gather together from all parts to
it, and keep for that purpose directly over the Kraken; he then
opens his arms or horns, seizes and swallows his welcome guests,
and converts them after due time, by digestion, into a bait for
other fish of the same kind. I relate what is affirmed by many;
but I cannot give so certain assurances of this particular, as I can
of the existence of this surprising creature; though I do not find
anything in it absolutely contrary to Nature. As we can hardly
expect to examine this enormous sea-animal alive, I am the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
concerned that nobody embraced that opportunity which, according
to the following account once did, and perhaps never more may
offer, of seeing it entire when dead."</p></blockquote>

<p>The lost opportunity which the worthy prelate thus
lamented, with the true feeling of a naturalist, was made
known to him by the Rev. Mr. Friis, Consistorial Assessor,
Minister of Bodoen in Nordland, and Vicar of the
college for promoting Christian knowledge, and was to the
following effect:</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the year 1680, a Krake (perhaps a young and foolish one)
came into the water that runs between the rocks and cliffs in the
parish of Alstaboug, though the general custom of that creature is
to keep always several leagues from land, and therefore of course
they must die there. It happened that its extended long arms or
antenn&aelig;, which this creature seems to use like the snail in turning
about, caught hold of some trees standing near the water,
which might easily have been torn up by the roots; but beside
this, as it was found afterwards, he entangled himself in some
openings or clefts in the rock, and therein stuck so fast, and hung
so unfortunately, that he could not work himself out, but perished
and putrefied on the spot. The carcass, which was a long while
decaying, and filled great part of that narrow channel, made it
almost impassable by its intolerable stench.</p>

<p>"The Kraken has never been known to do any great harm,
except," the Author quaintly says, "they have taken away the lives
of those who consequently could not bring the tidings. I have
heard but one instance mentioned, which happened a few years
ago, near Fridrichstad, in the diocess of Aggerhuus. They say that
two fishermen accidentally, and to their great surprise, fell into
such a spot on the water as has been before described, full of a thick
slime almost like a morass. They immediately strove to get out of
this place, but they had not time to turn quick enough to save
themselves from one of the Kraken's horns, which crushed the
head of the boat, so that it was with great difficulty they saved
their lives on the wreck, though the weather was as calm as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
possible; for these monsters, like the sea-snake, never appear at
other times."</p></blockquote>

<p>Pontoppidan then reviews the stories of floating islands
which suddenly appear, and as suddenly vanish, commonly
credited, and especially mentioned by Luke Debes in his
'Description of Faroe.'</p>

<blockquote><p>"These islands in the boisterous ocean could not be imagined,"
he says, "to be of the nature of real floating islands, because they
could not possibly stand against the violence of the waves in the
ocean, which break the largest vessels, and therefore our sailors
have concluded this delusion could come from no other than the
great deceiver, the devil."</p></blockquote>

<p>This accusation, the good bishop, in his desire to be
strictly impartial, will not admit on such hear-say evidence,
but is determined to, literally, "give the devil his due;"
for he warns his readers that "we ought not to charge
that apostate spirit without a cause; for," he adds, "I
rather think that this devil who so suddenly makes and
unmakes these floating islands, is nothing else but the
Kraken."</p>

<p>Referring to a monster described by Pliny, he repeats
his belief that "This sea-animal belongs to the Polype, or
Star-fish species;" but he becomes very much "mixed"
between the <i>Cephalopoda</i> and the <i>Asterid&aelig;</i>, between the
pedal segments, or arms, of the cuttle radiating from its
head, and the rays of a Star-fish radiating from a central
portion of the body. He evidently inclines strongly
towards a particular Star-fish, the rays of which continually
divide and subdivide themselves, or, as he describes it,
"which shoots its rays into branches like those of trees,"
and to which he gave the name of "Medusa's Head," a title
by which, in its Greek form, <i>Gorgonocephalus</i>, it is still
known to zoologists. "These Medusa's Heads," he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
"are supposed by some seafaring people here, to be the
young of the Sea-Krake; perhaps they are its smallest
ovula." After considering other reports concerning the
Kraken, he arrives at the following definite opinion:</p>

<blockquote><p>"We learn from all this that the Polype or Starfish have amongst
their various species some that are much larger than others; and,
according to all appearance, amongst the very largest inhabitants
of the ocean. If the axiom be true that greatness or littleness
makes no change in the species, then this Krake must be of the
Polypus kind, notwithstanding its enormous size."</p></blockquote>

<p>His diagnosis is correct; but it is stated with a modesty
which his detractors would do well to imitate; and his
concluding words on this subject place him in a light
very different from that in which he is popularly regarded:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I do not in the least insist on this conjecture being true," he
writes, "but willingly submit my suppositions in this and every
other dubious matter to the judgment of those who are better
experienced. If I was an admirer of uncertain reports and fabulous
stories, I might here add much more concerning this and other
Norwegian sea-monsters, whose existence I will not take upon me
to deny, but do not chuse, by a mixture of uncertain relations to
make such account appear doubtful as I myself believe to be true
and well attested. I shall therefore quit the subject here, and
leave it to future writers on this plan to complete what I have
imperfectly sketched out, by further experience, which is always
the best instructor."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is easy to recognise in Pontoppidan's description of
the Kraken, the form and habits of one of the "Cuttle-fishes,"
so-called. The appearance of its numerous arms,
with which it gathers in its food, and which grow thicker
and thicker as they rise above the surface, is just what
would take place in the case of one of the pelagic species
of these mollusks raising its head out of the sea. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
rendering of the water turbid and thick by the emission of
a substance which the narrator supposed to be f&aelig;cal
matter, is exactly that which occurs when a cuttle discharges
the contents of the remarkable organ known as
its ink-bag; and the strong and peculiar scent mentioned
as appertaining to it, is actually characteristic of its inky
secretion. The musky odour referred to, is more perceptible
in some species than in others. In one of the Octopods
(<i>Eledone moschatus</i>), it is so strong, that the specific
name of the animal is derived from it.</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks and Romans, who were well acquainted
with the various kinds of cuttles and regarded
them all as excellent food, and even as delicacies of the
table, applied the word "polypus" especially to the
octopus. But Pontoppidan evidently uses it as descriptive
of all the cephalopods. It must not be forgotten, however,
that when he wrote, science was only slowly recovering
from neglect of many centuries' duration. In the enlightened
times of Greece and Rome, natural history
flourished, and as in our day, attracted and occupied the
attention of the man of science, and afforded recreation to
the man of business and the politician. Aristotle wrote
322 years before the birth of Christ, and his works are
monuments of practical wisdom. When we consider the
period during which he lived, and the isolated nature of his
labours, and compare them with the information which he
possessed, we are astonished at his sagacity and the great
scope and general accuracy of his knowledge. Pliny, 240
years later, lived in times more favourable for the cultivation
of science; but with all his advantages made little
improvement on the work of the great master. And then,
later still, the sun of learning set; and there came over
Europe the long night of the dark ages which succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Roman greatness, during which science was degraded and
ignorance prevailed; and it is not till the middle of the
sixteenth century, that the zoologist finds much to interest
and instruct him. When we further reflect, that until
within the past five and twenty years&mdash;till our large
aquaria were constructed&mdash;Aristotle's knowledge of the
habits and life-history of marine animals, and amongst them
the cephalopods, was incomparably greater and more perfect
than that possessed by any man who had lived since he
recorded his observations, we cannot help feeling that in
some departments of knowledge there is still lost ground to
be recovered.</p>

<p>In the old days of the C&aelig;sars, a Greek or Roman house-wife
who was accustomed to see the cuttle, the squid, and
the octopus daily exposed for sale in the markets, would
of course have laughed at the idea of mistaking the one for
the other; but there are comparatively few persons in our
own country, at the present day, except those who have
made marine zoology their study, whose ideas on the subject
are not exceedingly hazy. This want of technical
knowledge is not confined to the masses; but is common,
if not general, amongst those who have been well educated,
and is frequently apparent even in leaders in the daily
papers&mdash;the productions, for the most part, of men of
receptive minds, trained discrimination, and great general
knowledge. As the subject is one in which I have long
felt especial interest, I venture to hope that I may succeed
in making clear the difference between the eight-footed
octopus and its ten-footed relatives, and thus enable the
reader to identify the member of the family from which we
are to strip the dress and "make up" in which it masqueraded
as the Kraken, and cause it to appear in its true
and natural form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the great primary groups or divisions of the
animal kingdom is that of the soft-bodied mollusca; which
includes the cuttle, the oyster, the snail, &amp;c. It has been
separated into five "classes," of which the one we have
especially to notice is the <i>Cephalopoda</i>,<a name="Anchor_5_5" id="Anchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">&nbsp;[5]&nbsp;</a> or "head-footed,"&mdash;the
animals belonging to it having their feet, or the
organs which correspond with the foot of other molluscs, so
attached to the head as to form a circle or coronet round
the mouth. Some of these have the foot divided into eight
segments, and are therefore called the <i>Octopoda</i>:<a name="Anchor_6_6" id="Anchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">&nbsp;[6]&nbsp;</a> others
have, in addition to the eight feet, lobes, or arms, two
longer tentacular appendages, making ten in all, and are
consequently called the <i>Decapoda</i>.</p>

<p>Of the ten-footed section of the cephalopods, there are
four "families;" two only of which exist in Britain&mdash;the
<i>Teuthid&aelig;</i>, and the <i>Sepiid&aelig;</i>. The <i>Teuthid&aelig;</i> are the Calamaries,
popularly known as "Squids," and are represented
by the long-bodied <i>Loligo vulgaris</i>, that has internally
along its back a gristly, translucent stiffener, shaped like a
quill-pen; from which and its ink it derives its names of
"calamary" (from "<i>calamus</i>," a "pen"), "pen-and-ink
fish," and "sea-clerk." The <i>Sepiid&aelig;</i> are generally known
as the Cuttles proper. As a type of them we may take the
common "cuttle-fish," <i>Sepia officinalis</i>, the owner of the
hard, calcareous shell often thrown up on the shore, and
known as "cuttle-bone," or "sea-biscuit."</p>

<p>It must here be remarked, that as these head-footed mollusks
are not "fish," any more than lobsters, crabs, oysters,
mussels, &amp;c., which fishmongers call "shell-fish," are "fish,"
the word "fish" is misleading, and should be abandoned;
and secondly, that the names "cuttle" and "squid," as distinctive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>appellations, are unsatisfactory. The word "cuttle"
is derived from "cuddle," to hug, or embrace&mdash;in allusion
to the manner in which the animal seizes its prey, and enfolds
it in its arms; and "squid" is derived from "squirt,"
in reference to its habit of squirting water or ink. But as
all the known members of the class, except the pearly
nautilus, <i>Nautilus pompilius</i>, have these habits in common,
the distinguishing terms are hardly apposite. As, however,
they are conventionally accepted and understood, I prefer
to use them. As with other mollusks, so with the cephalopods,
some have shells, and some are naked or have only
rudimentary shells. The Argonaut, or paper nautilus, has
been regarded as the analogue of the snail, which, like it,
secretes an <i>external</i> shell for the protection of its soft body;
and the octopus as that of the garden slug, which, having
organs like those of the snail, as the octopus has organs
like those of the shell-bearing argonaut, has no shell. The
cuttles and squids may be compared to some of the sea-slugs,
as <i>Aplysia</i> and <i>Bull&aelig;a</i>, and to some land-slugs, as
<i>Parmacella</i> and <i>Limax</i>, which have an <i>internal</i> shell.</p>

<p>The argonaut and the other families of the cephalopods
do not come within the scope of this treatise; we will therefore
confine our attention to the three above mentioned. Of
the anatomy and homology of the <i>Octopus</i>, <i>Sepia</i>, and <i>Calamary</i>
we need say no more than will suffice to show in what
manner they resemble each other, and wherein they differ,
in order that we may the more clearly perceive to which of
them the story of the Kraken probably owes its origin.</p>

<p>The octopus, the sepia, and the calamary are all constructed
on one fundamental plan. A bag of fleshy
muscular skin, called the mantle-sac, contains the organs
of the body, heart, stomach, liver, intestines, a pair of gills
by which oxygen is absorbed from the water for the purification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of the blood, and an excurrent tube by which the
water thus deprived of its life-sustaining gas is expelled.
The outrush of water with more or less force, from this
"syphon-tube," is also the principal source of locomotion
when the animal is swimming, as it propels it backward&mdash;not
by the striking of the expelled fluid against the surrounding
water, as is generally supposed; but by the unbalanced
pressure of the fluid acting inside the body in the direction
in which the creature goes. Into this syphon-tube, or
funnel, opens, by a special duct, the ink-bag; and from it
is squirted at will the intensely black fluid therein secreted.
I doubt very much the correctness of the statement
mentioned by Pontoppidan and others, that the cuttle
ejects its ink with a desire to lie hidden and in ambush
for its intended prey, or with the intention to attract fish
within its reach by their partiality for the musky odour of
this secretion. It may be so, but during the long period
that I had these animals under close observation at the
Brighton Aquarium, I never witnessed such an incident.
I believe that the emission of the ink is a symptom
of fear, and is only employed as a means of concealment
from a suspected enemy. I have found, that
when first taken, the <i>Sepia</i>, of all its kind, is the most
sensitively timid. Its keen, unwinking eye watches for
and perceives the slightest movement of its captor; and if
even most cautiously looked at from above, its ink is
belched forth in eddying volumes, rolling over and over
like the smoke which follows the discharge of a great gun
from a ship's port, and mixes with marvellous rapidity with
the surrounding water. But, like all of its class, the <i>Sepia</i>
is very intelligent. It soon learns to discriminate between
friend and foe, and ultimately becomes very tame, and
ceases to shoot its ink, unless it be teased and excited. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
means of the communication between the ink-bag and the
locomotor tube, it happens that when the ink is ejected,
a stream of water is forcibly emitted with it, and thus the
very effort for escape serves the double purpose of propelling
the creature away from danger, and discolouring
the water in which it moves. Oppian has well described
this&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The endangered cuttle thus evades his fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And native hoards of fluids safely wears.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Professor Owen has remarked that the ejection of the
ink of the cephalopods serves by its colour as a means of
defence, as corresponding secretions in some of the mammalia
by their odour.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice that the pearly nautilus and the
allied fossil forms are without this means of concealment,
which their strong external shells render unnecessary for
their protection.</p>

<p>From the sac-like body containing the various organs,
protrudes a head, globose in shape, and containing a brain,
and furnished with a pair of strong, horny mandibles, which
bite vertically, like the beak of a parrot. By these the
flesh of prey is torn and partly masticated, and within
them lies the tongue, covered with recurved and retractile
teeth, like that of its distant relatives, the whelk,
limpet, &amp;c., by which the food is conducted to the gullet.
Around this head is, as I have said, the organ which is
equivalent to the foot in other molluscs&mdash;that by which
the slug and the snail crawl&mdash;only that the head is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
placed in the centre, instead of in the front of it, and it
is divided into segments, which radiate from this central
head. These segments are very flexible, and capable of
movement in every direction, and are thus developed
into arms, prehensile limbs, by which their owner can
seize and hold its living prey. That this may be more
perfectly accomplished, these arms are studded along
their inner surface with rows of sucking discs, in each of
which, by means of a retractile piston, a vacuum can
be produced. The consequent pressure of the outer atmosphere
or water, causes them to adhere firmly to any
substance to which they are applied, whether stone, fish,
crustacean, or flesh of man.</p>

<p>But, although in all these highly-organised head-footed
mollusks the same general build prevails, it is admirably
modified in each of them to suit certain habits and necessities.
Thus the octopus, being a shore dweller, its soft
and pliant, but very tough body, having merely a very
small and rudimentary indication of an internal shell (just
a little "style") is exactly adapted for wedging itself
amongst crevices of rocks. A large, rigid, cellular float, or
"sepiostaire," such as <i>Sepia</i> possesses, or a long, horny pen
such as <i>Loligo</i> has, would be in the way, and worse than
useless in such places as the octopus inhabits. Its eight
long powerful arms or feet are precisely fitted for clambering
over rocks and stones, and as its food of course consists
principally of the living things most abundant in such
localities, namely, the shore-crabs, its great flexible suckers,
devoid of hooks or horny armature, are exactly adapted to
firm and air-tight attachment to the smooth shells of the
crustacea.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 1.--BEAK AND ARMS OF A DECAPOD CUTTLE.<br /> a, the eight shorter arms; t, the tentacles; f, the funnel, or locomotor tube.</span>
</div>

<p>Unlike the octopus, which is capable only of short flights
through the water, the "cuttles" and "squids," such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<i>Sepia</i> and <i>Loligo</i>, are all free swimmers. For them it is
necessary for accuracy of natation that their soft, and in
the squids long bodies, should be supported by such a
framework as they possess. In <i>Sepia</i>, the mantle-sac is
flattened horizontally all along its lateral edges so as to
form a pair of fins, which nearly surround the trunk. These
fins could never be used, as they are, to enable the animal
to poise itself delicately in the water by means of their
beautiful undulations, which I have often watched with
delight, if their attached edges were not kept in a straight
line on either side. Then, these ten-footed or ten-armed
genera have not, because they need them not, eight long,
strong and highly mobile arms like those of the octopus, nor
have they large suckers upon them. Whereas a great length
of reach is an advantage to the octopus, animals which are
purely swimmers, and which hunt and overtake their prey
by speed, would be impeded by having to drag after them
a bundle of stout, lengthy appendages trailing heavily
astern. Their eight pedal arms are short and comparatively
weak, though strong enough, in individuals such as are
regarded on our own coasts as fullgrown, to seize and hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a fish or crustacean as strong as a good sized shore-crab.
But, as compensation for the shortness of the eight arms, they
are provided with two others more than three times the
length of the short ones. These are so slender that they
generally lie coiled up in a spiral cone in two pockets, one
on each side, just below the eye, when the animal is
quiescent, and are only seen when it takes its food. These
long, slender tentacular arms are expanded at their extremity,
and the inner surface of their enlarged part is studded
with suckers&mdash;some of them larger in size than those on
the eight shorter arms. As the food of these swimmers
consists, of course, chiefly of fish, their sucking disks are
curiously modified for the better retention of a slippery
captive. A horny ring with a sharply serrated edge is imbedded
in the outer circumference of each of them, and
when a vacuum is formed, the keen, saw-like teeth are
pressed into the skin or scales of the unfortunate prisoner,
and deprive it of the slightest chance of escape.</p>

<p>The manner in which the eight-armed and ten-armed
cephalopods capture their prey is similar in principle and
plan, but differs in action in accordance with their mode of
life. The ordinary habit of the octopus is either to rest
suspended to the side of a rock to which it clings with the
suckers of several of its arms, or to remain lurking in some
favourite cranny; its body thrust for protection and concealment
well back in the interior of the recess; its bright eyes
keenly on the watch; three or four of its limbs firmly
attached to the walls of its hiding place&mdash;the others gently
waving, gliding, and feeling about in the water, as if to
maintain its vigilance, and keep itself always on the alert,
and in readiness to pounce on any unfortunate wayfarer
that may pass near its den. To a shore-crab that comes
within its reach the slightest contact with one of those lithe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
arms is fatal. Instantaneously as pull of trigger brings
down a bird, or touch of electric wire explodes a torpedo or
a mining fuse, the pistons of the series of suckers are
simultaneously drawn inward, the air is removed from the
pneumatic holders, and a vacuum created in each: the crab
tries to escape, but in a second is completely pinioned:
not a movement, not a struggle is possible; each leg, each
claw is grasped all over by suckers, enfolded in them,
stretched out to its fullest extent by them; the back of
the carapace is completely covered by the tenacious disks,
brought together by the adaptable contractions of the limb,
and ranged in close order, shoulder to shoulder, touching
each other; and the pressure of the air is so great that
nothing can effect the relaxation of their retentive power but
the destruction of the air-pump that works them, or the
closing of the throttle-valve by which they are connected
with it. Meanwhile the abdominal plates of the captive
crab are dragged towards the mouth; the black tip of the
hard horny beak is seen for a single instant protruding
from the circular orifice in the centre of the radiation of
the arms; and, the next, has crushed through the shell, and
is buried deep in the flesh of the victim.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 2.&mdash;THE OCTOPUS (Octopus vulgaris).</span>
</div>

<p>Unlike the skulking, hiding octopus, its ten-armed relative,
the <i>Sepia</i> loves the daylight and the freedom of the
upper water. Its predatory acts are not those of a concealed
and ambushed brigand lying in wait behind a
rock, or peeping furtively from within the gloomy shadow
of a cave; but it may better be compared to the war-like
Comanche vidette seated gracefully on his horse, and scanning
from some elevated knoll a wide expanse of prairie, in
readiness to swoop upon a weak or unarmed foe. Poised
near the surface of the water, like a hawk in the air, the
<i>Sepia</i> moves gently to and fro by graceful undulations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
its lateral fins,&mdash;an exquisite play of colour occasionally
taking place over its beautifully barred and mottled back.
When thus tranquil, its eight pedal arms are usually
brought close together, and droop in front of its head, like
the trunk of an elephant, shortened; its two longer tentacular
arms being coiled up within their pouches and unseen.
Only when some small fish approaches it does it arouse
itself. Then, its eyes dilate, and its colours become more
bright and vivid. It carefully takes aim, advancing or
retreating to such a distance as will just allow the two
hidden tentacles to reach the quarry when they shall be shot
out. Next, the two highest or central feet are lifted up,
and the three others on each side are spread aside, so that
they may be all out of the way of the two concealed tentacles,
presently to be launched forth; and then, in a
moment&mdash;so instantaneously that the eye of an observer,
be he ever so watchful, can hardly see the act&mdash;this pair
of tentacles, side by side, are projected and withdrawn, as
if in a flash. The fish or shrimp has vanished, the suckers
of the dilated ends of the tentacles having adhered to it,
and left it, as they re-entered their pouches, within the fatal
"cuddle," or embrace, where it is torn to pieces by the
devouring beak.<a name="Anchor_7_7" id="Anchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">&nbsp;[7]&nbsp;</a> This action of the tentacles of the
decapods is the most rapid motion that I know of in the
whole animal kingdom&mdash;not excepting even that of the
tongue of the toad and the lizard. These long tentacles
are not used when the food is within reach of the shorter
arms.</p>

<p>The calamaries or squids of our British Seas seize their
prey in the same manner as <i>Sepia</i>, and the description of one
will suffice for both. But there exist two groups of them,
which are armed with curved and sharp-pointed hooks or
claws, either in addition to, or instead of suckers. In the
one group (<i>Onychoteuthis</i>), the hooks are restricted to the
extremities of the pair of tentacles, in the other (<i>Enoploteuthis</i>),
both the tentacles and the shorter arms have hooks.
Professor Owen, in his description of these hook-armed
calamaries in the <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of Anatomy</i>, notices also
another structure which adds greatly to their prehensile
power (<a href="#fig_004">Fig. 4.</a>). "At the extremity of the long tentacles a cluster
of small, simple, unarmed suckers may be observed at the
base of the expanded part. When these latter suckers are
applied to one another the tentacles are securely locked
together at that part, and the united strength of both the
elongated peduncles can be applied to drag towards the
mouth any resisting object which has been grappled by the
terminal hooks. There is no mechanical contrivance which
surpasses this structure; art has remotely imitated it in
the fabrication of the obstetrical forceps, in which either
blade can be used separately, or, by the inter-locking of a
temporary blade, be made to act in combination."</p>

<p>The cephalopods obtain and eat their food very much
like the rapacious birds. They are the falcons of the sea.
Some of them, like <i>Onychoteuthis</i>, strike their prey with
talons and suckers also, others lay hold of it with
suckers alone; but they all tear the flesh with their beaks,
and swallow and digest their food in the same manner as
the hawk or vulture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Sepia</i>, the owner of the broad, flattened bone, has a
decided predilection for the vicinity of the shore, and for
comparatively shallow water. It
there attaches its grape-like eggs
to some convenient stone or growing
alga, and delights occasionally
to sink to the bottom, and there
to rest half covered by the sand,
a habit for which the form of its
body is well adapted. But the
calamaries&mdash;they of the horny pen&mdash;prefer
the wide waters of the
open ocean; and although they,
too, especially the smaller species,
are common upon the coasts, they
are frequently met with far out at
sea, and away from any land. The
elongated and almost arrow-like
shape of their bodies enables them
to glide through the water with
great rapidity, and the momentum
exerted by a vigorous out-rush from
their syphon-tube is sometimes so
great that when the opposite pressure
thus produced is so exerted as
to cause them to take an upward
direction they leap out of the water
to so great a height as to fall on the
decks of ships; and are, therefore,
called by sailors, "flying squids."
Their spawn is very different from
that of either octopus, or sepia. It
consists of dozens of semi-transparent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
gelatinous, slender, cylindrical sheaths, about four
or five inches long, each containing many ova imbedded
in it (making a total number of about 40,000 embryos), all
springing from a common centre and resembling a mop
without a handle. I have never seen any of these "sea-mops"
attached to anything, and the pelagic habits of the
calamaries render it probable that they are left floating on
the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>Having made ourselves acquainted with the structure
and habits of these three divisions of the eight-footed and
ten-footed mollusks, let us take evidence as to the size to
which they are respectively known to attain, and the degree
in which they may be regarded as dangerous to man.</p>

<p>An octopus from our own coasts having arms two feet in
length may be considered a rather large specimen; and
Dr. J. E. Gray, who was always most kindly ready to place
at the disposal of any sincere inquirer the vast store of
knowledge laid up in his wonderful memory, told me that
"there is not one in the British Museum which exceeds
this size, or which would not go into a quart pot&mdash;body,
arms and all." The largest British specimen I have hitherto
seen had arms 2 ft. 6 in. long. We have sufficient evidence,
however, that it exceeds this in the South of France, and
along the Spanish and Italian coasts of the Mediterranean;
and my deceased friend John Keast Lord tells us in his
book, 'The Naturalist in British Columbia,' that he saw
and measured, in Vancouver's Island, an octopus which
had arms five feet long.</p>

<p>I have often been asked whether an octopus of
the ordinary size can really be dangerous to bathers.
Decidedly, "Yes," in certain situations. The holding
power of its numerous suckers is enormous. It is
almost impossible forcibly to detach it from its adhesion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to a rock or the flat bottom of a tank; and if a large one
happened to fix one or more of its strong, tough arms on
the leg of a swimmer whilst the others held firmly to a rock,
I doubt if the man could disengage himself under water
by mere strength, before being exhausted. Fortunately
the octopus can be made to relax its hold by grasping it
tightly round the "throat" (if I may so call it), and it may
be well that this should be known.</p>

<p>That men are occasionally drowned by these creatures
is, unhappily, a fact too well attested. I have elsewhere<a name="Anchor_8_8" id="Anchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">&nbsp;[8]&nbsp;</a>
related several instances of this having occurred.
Omitting those, I will give two or three others which have
since come under my notice. Sir Grenville Temple, in his
'Excursions in the Mediterranean Sea,' tells how a Sardinian
captain, whilst bathing at Jerbeh, was seized and drowned
by an octopus. When his body was found, his limbs were
bound together by the arms of the animal; and this took
place in water only four feet deep.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord's account of the formidable strength of
these creatures in Oregon is confirmed by an incident
recorded in the <i>Weekly Oregonian</i> (the principal paper of
Oregon) of October 6th, 1877. A few days before that
date an Indian woman, whilst bathing, was held beneath
the surface by an octopus, and drowned. The body was
discovered on the following day in the horrid embrace of
the creature. Indians dived down and with their knives
severed the arms of the octopus and recovered the corpse.</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens Laming, in his book, 'The French in Algiers,'
writes:&mdash;"The soldiers were in the habit of bathing
in the sea every evening, and from time to time several of
them disappeared&mdash;no one knew how. Bathing was, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
consequence, strictly forbidden; in spite of which several
men went into the water one evening. Suddenly one of
them screamed for help, and when several others rushed to
his assistance they found that an octopus had seized him
by the leg by four of its arms whilst it clung to the rock
with the rest. The soldiers brought the 'monster' home
with them, and out of revenge they boiled it alive and ate
it. This adventure accounted for the disappearance of the
other soldiers."</p>

<p>The Rev. W. Wyatt Gill, who for more than a quarter
of a century has resided as a missionary amongst the inhabitants
of the Hervey Islands, and with whom I had the
pleasure of conversing on this subject when he was in
England in 1875, described in the <i>Leisure Hour</i> of April
20th, 1872, another mode of attack by which an octopus might
deprive a man of life. A servant of his went diving for
"poulpes" (octopods), leaving his son in charge of the
canoe. After a short time he rose to the surface, his arms
free, but his nostrils and mouth completely covered by a
large octopus. If his son had not promptly torn the
living plaister from off his face he must have been suffocated&mdash;a
fate which actually befell some years previously a
man who foolishly went diving alone.</p>

<p>In <i>Appleton's American Journal of Science and Art</i>,
January 31st, 1874, a correspondent describes an attack
by an octopus on a diver who was at work on the wreck of
a sunken steamer off the coast of Florida. The man, a powerful
Irishman, was helpless in its grasp, and would have been
drowned if he had not been quickly brought to the surface;
for when dragged on to the raft from which he had
descended, he fainted, and his companions were unable to
pull the creature from its hold upon him until they had
dealt it a sharp blow across its baggy body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>A similar incident occurred to the government diver of
the colony of Victoria, Australia. Whilst pursuing his
avocation in the estuary of the river Moyne he was seized
by an octopus. He killed it by striking it with an iron
bar, and brought to shore with him a portion of it with the
arms more than three feet long.</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence Oliphant, in his 'China and Japan,' describes
a Japanese show, which consisted of "a series of groups
of figures carved in wood, the size of life, and as cleverly
coloured as Madame Tussaud's wax-works. One of these
was a group of women bathing in the sea. One of them
had been caught in the folds of a cuttle-fish; the others,
in alarm, were escaping, leaving their companion to her
fate. The cuttle-fish was represented on a huge scale, its
eyes, eyelids, and mouth being made to move simultaneously
by a man inside the head."</p>

<p>An attack of this kind is most artistically represented
in a small Japanese ivory-carving in the possession of
Mr. Bartlett, of the Zoological Gardens.<a name="Anchor_9_9" id="Anchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">&nbsp;[9]&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>The Japanese are well acquainted with the octopus; for
it is commonly depicted on their ornaments, and forms no
unimportant item in their fisheries.</p>

<p>I have recently had an opportunity of inspecting a most
curious Japanese book, in the possession of my friend Mr.
W. B. Tegetmeier, which is chiefly devoted to the representations
of the fisheries and fish-curing processes of the
country. It is in three volumes, and is entitled, 'Land and
Sea Products,' by Ki Kone. It is evidently ancient, for it
is slightly worm-eaten, but the plates, each 12 inches by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>8 inches, are full of vigour. Two of these illustrate in a
very interesting manner the subject before us, and by the
kindness of Mr. Tegetmeier I am able to give facsimiles of
them, which appeared with an article by him on this book,
in the <i>Field</i> of March 14th, 1874. <a href="#fig_005">Fig. 5</a> represents a fisherman
in a boat out at sea: a gigantic octopus has thrown
one of its arms over the side of the boat; the man, who is
alone, has started forward from the stern of the boat, and
has succeeded, by means of a large knife attached to a long
handle, in lopping off the dangerous limb of his enemy.
As Mr. Tegetmeier says, "From the extreme matter of fact
manner in which all these engravings are made, and the total
absence of exaggeration in any other representation, I cannot
but regard the relative sizes of the man, the boat, and
the octopus, as correctly given, in which case we have
evidence of the existence of gigantic cephalopods in
Japanese waters." The only doubt I have is whether the
fisherman correctly described his assailant as an octopus,
and whether it was not a calamary. <a href="#fig_006">Fig. </a>6 is a vivid
picture of a fishmonger's shop in a market, under the awning
of which may be seen two arms of a gigantic cuttle hung
up for sale as food. These are evidently of most unusual
size, judging from the action of the lookers on; the one
to the left, with a tall stand or case on his back, like a
Parisian cocoa-vendor, is holding out his hand in mute
astonishment; whilst the attention of the smaller personage
in the right-hand corner is directed to the suspended arms
of the cuttle by the man nearest to him, who is pointing to
them with upraised hand. In another plate in this most
interesting work a Japanese mode of fishing for cuttles is
delineated. A man in a boat is tossing crabs, one at a
time, into the sea, and when a cuttle rises at the bait he
spears it with a trident and tosses it into the boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>The octopus, therefore, though not abundant on our own
coasts, is found in every sea in the temperate zone; and in
so far as that it secretes an ink with which it can render
the water turbid, and has many radiating arms with which
it can seize and drown a man, it possesses certain attributes
of the Kraken; but we have no authentic knowledge
of its ever attaining to greater dimensions than I have
stated, nor does it bask on the surface of the sea. It is not
amongst the <i>Octopid&aelig;</i> therefore that we must look for a
solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>The basking condition is fulfilled by the <i>Sepia</i>; and its
flattened back, supported and rendered hard and firm to
the touch by the calcareous <i>sepiostaire</i> beneath the skin, is
broader in proportion than that of the octopus or the squid.
Thus <i>Sepia</i> might pass as a microscopic miniature of the
great Scandinavian monster. But it lacks the character of
size. We have no reason to believe that any true <i>Sepia</i>
exists, as the family is now understood, that has a body
more than eighteen inches long. If it were otherwise it would
be more likely to be known of this family than of its relatives,
for its lightly constructed and well known "cuttle-bone"
would float on the surface for many weeks after the death
of its owner, and large specimens of it would be seen and
recognised from passing ships.</p>

<p>As we can find no species of the <i>Octopid&aelig;</i> or <i>Sepiid&aelig;</i>
which can furnish a pretext for the stories told of the
Kraken, we must try to ascertain how far a similitude to it
may be traced in the third family we have discussed, the
<i>Teuthid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>The belief in the existence of gigantic cuttles is an
ancient one. Aristotle mentions it, and Pliny tells of an
enormous polypus which at Carteia, in Grenada&mdash;an old
and important Roman colony near Gibraltar&mdash;used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
come out of the sea at night, and carry off and devour
salted tunnies from the curing depots on the shore; and
adds that when it was at last killed, the head of it (they
used to call the body the head, because in swimming it
goes in advance) was found to weigh 700 lbs. &AElig;lian records
a similar incident, and describes his monster as
crushing in its arms the barrels of salt fish to get at the
contents. These two must have been octopods if they
were anything; the word "polypus" thus especially
designates it, and moreover, the free-swimming cuttles and
squids would be helpless if stranded on the shore. Some
of the old writers seem to have aimed rather at making their
histories sensational than at carefully investigating the
credibility or the contrary of the highly coloured reports
brought to them. These were, of course, gross exaggerations,
but there was generally a substratum of truth in
them. They were based on the rare occurrence of specimens,
smaller certainly, but still enormous, of some known
species, and in most cases the worst that can be said of
their authors is that they were culpably careless and foolishly
credulous.</p>

<p>Unhappily so lenient a judgment cannot be passed on
some comparatively recent writers. Denys de Montfort,
half a century later than Pontoppidan, not only professed
to believe in the Kraken, but also in the existence of
another gigantic animal distinct from it; a colossal <i>poulpe</i>,
or octopus, compared with which Pliny's was a mere
pigmy. In a drawing fitter to decorate the outside of a
showman's caravan at a fair than seriously to illustrate a
work on natural history,<a name="Anchor_10_10" id="Anchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">&nbsp;[10]&nbsp;</a> he depicted this tremendous
cuttle as throwing its arms over a three masted vessel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>snapping off its masts, tearing down the yards, and on the
point of dragging it to the bottom, if the crew had not succeeded
in cutting off its immense limbs with cutlasses and
hatchets. De Montfort had good opportunities of obtaining
information, for he was at one time an assistant in the
geological department of the Museum of Natural History,
in Paris; and wrote a work on conchology,<a name="Anchor_11_11" id="Anchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">&nbsp;[11]&nbsp;</a> besides that
already referred to. But it appears to have been his deliberate
purpose to cajole the public; for it is reported
that he exclaimed to M. Defrance: "If my entangled
ship is accepted, I will make my 'colossal poulpe' overthrow
a whole fleet." Accordingly we find him gravely
declaring<a name="Anchor_12_12" id="Anchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">&nbsp;[12]&nbsp;</a> that one of the great victories of the British
navy was converted into a disaster by the monsters
which are the subject of his history. He boldly asserted
that the six men-of-war captured from the French by
Admiral Rodney in the West Indies on the 12th of April,
1782, together with four British ships detached from his
fleet to convoy the prizes, were all suddenly engulphed in
the waves on the night of the battle under such circumstances
as showed that the catastrophe was caused by
colossal cuttles, and not by a gale or any ordinary casualty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">

</a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 7.&mdash;FACSIMILE OF DE MONTFORT&#39;S &quot;Poulpe colossal.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately for De Montfort, the inexorable logic of
facts not only annihilates his startling theory, but demonstrates
the reckless falsity of his plausible statements. The
captured vessels did not sink on the night of the action,
but were all sent to Jamaica to refit, and arrived there
safely. Five months afterwards, however, a convoy of nine
line-of-battle ships (amongst which were Rodney's prizes),
one frigate, and about a hundred merchantmen, were dispersed,
whilst on their voyage to England, by a violent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>storm, during which some of them unfortunately foundered.
The various accidents which preceded the loss of these
vessels was related in evidence to the Admiralty by the
survivors, and official documents prove that De Montfort's
fleet-destroying <i>poulpe</i> was an invention of his own, and
had no part whatever in the disaster that he attributed
to it.</p>

<p>I have been told, but cannot vouch for the truth of
the report, that De Montfort's propensity to write that
which was not true culminated in his committing forgery,
and that he died in the galleys. But he records a statement
of Captain Jean Magnus Dens, said to have been
a respectable and veracious man, who, after having made
several voyages to China as a master trader, retired from a
seafaring life and lived at Dunkirk. He told De Montfort
that in one of his voyages, whilst crossing from St. Helena
to Cape Negro, he was becalmed, and took advantage of
the enforced idleness of the crew to have the vessel scraped
and painted. Whilst three of his men were standing on
planks slung over the side, an enormous cuttle rose from
the water, and threw one of its arms around two of the
sailors, whom it tore away, with the scaffolding on which
they stood. With another arm it seized the third man, who
held on tightly to the rigging, and shouted for help. His
shipmates ran to his assistance, and succeeded in rescuing
him by cutting away the creature's arm with axes and
knives, but he died delirious on the following night. The
captain tried to save the other two sailors by killing the
animal, and drove several harpoons into it; but they broke
away, and the men were carried down by the monster.</p>

<p>The arm cut off was said to have been twenty-five feet
long, and as thick as the mizen-yard, and to have had on it
suckers as big as saucepan-lids. I believe the old sea-captain's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
narrative of the incident to be true; the dimensions
given by De Montfort are wilfully and deliberately false.
The belief in the power of the cuttle to sink a ship and
devour her crew is as widely spread over the surface of the
globe, as it is ancient in point of time. I have been told
by a friend that he saw in a shop in China a picture of a
cuttle embracing a junk, apparently of about 300 tons
burthen, and helping itself to the sailors, as one picks
gooseberries off a bush.</p>

<p>Traditions of a monstrous cuttle attacking and destroying
ships are current also at the present day in the Polynesian
Islands. Mr. Gill, the missionary previously quoted, tells
us<a name="Anchor_13_13" id="Anchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">&nbsp;[13]&nbsp;</a> that the natives of Aitutaki, in the Hervey group, have
a legend of a famous explorer, named Rata, who built a
double canoe, decked and rigged it, and then started off in
quest of adventures. At the prow was stationed the dauntless
Nganaoa, armed with a long spear and ready to slay
all monsters. One day when speeding pleasantly over the
ocean, the voice of the ever vigilant Nganaoa was heard:
"O Rata! yonder is a terrible enemy starting up from
ocean depths." It proved to be an octopus (query, squid?)
of extraordinary dimensions. Its huge tentacles encircled
the vessel in their embrace, threatening its instant destruction.
At this critical moment Nganaoa seized his spear, and
fearlessly drove it through the head of the creature. The
tentacles slowly relaxed, and the dead monster floated off
on the surface of the ocean.</p>

<p>Passing from the early records of the appearance of
cuttles of unusual size, and the current as well as
the traditional belief in their existence by the inhabitants
of many countries, let us take the testimony of travellers
and naturalists who have a right to be regarded as competent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
observers. In so doing we must bear in mind that
until Professor Owen propounded the very clear and convenient
classification now universally adopted, the squids,
as well as the eight-footed <i>Octopid&aelig;</i>, were all grouped
under the title of <i>Sepia</i>.</p>

<p>Pernetty, describing a voyage made by him in the years
1763-4,<a name="Anchor_14_14" id="Anchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">&nbsp;[14]&nbsp;</a> mentions gigantic cuttles met with in the Southern
Seas.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, during the first week in March 1769,
Banks and Solander, the scientific fellow-voyagers with
Lieutenant Cook (afterwards the celebrated Captain Cook),
in H.M.S. <i>Endeavour</i>, found in the North Pacific, in latitude
38&deg; 44&acute; S. and longitude 110&deg; 33&acute; W., a large calamary
which had just been killed by the birds, and was floating in
a mangled condition on the water. Its arms were furnished,
instead of suckers, with a double row of very sharp talons,
which resembled those of a cat, and, like them, were retractable
into a sheath of skin from which they might be thrust
at pleasure. Of this cuttle they say, with evident pleasurable
remembrance of a savoury meal, they made one of the
best soups they ever tasted. Professor Owen tells us, in the
paper already referred to, that when he was curator of the
Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, and
preparing, in 1829, his first catalogue thereof, he was struck
with the number of oceanic invertebrates which Hunter had
obtained. He learned from Mr. Clift that Hunter had supplied
Mr. (afterwards Sir Joseph) Banks with stoppered
bottles containing alcohol, in which to preserve the new
marine animals that he might meet with during the circumnavigatory
voyage about to be undertaken by Cook.
Thinking it probable that Banks might have stowed some
parts of this great hook-armed squid in one of these bottles for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>his anatomical friend, he searched for, and found in a bottle
marked "J. B.," portions of its arms, the beak with tongue, a
heart ventricle, &amp;c., and, amongst the dry preparations, the
terminal part of the body, with an attached pair of rhomboidal
fins. The remainder had furnished Cook and his
companions Banks and Solander with a welcome change of
diet in the commander's cabin of the <i>Endeavour</i>. As the
inner surface of the arms of the squid, as well as the
terminals of its tentacles, were studded with hooks, Professor
Owen named it <i>Enoploteuthis Cookii</i>. He estimates the
diameter of the tail fin at 15 inches, the length of its body
3 feet, of its head 10 inches, of the shorter arms 16 inches,
and of the longer tentacles about the same as its body&mdash;thus
giving a total length of about 6 ft. 9 in. Although
individuals of other species, of larger dimensions, are known
to have existed, this is the largest specimen of the hook-armed
calamaries that has been scientifically examined.
It would have been a formidable antagonist to a man under
circumstances favourable to the exertion of its strength, and
the use of its prehensile and lacerating talons.</p>

<p>Peron,<a name="Anchor_15_15" id="Anchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">&nbsp;[15]&nbsp;</a> the well-known French zoologist, mentions having
seen at sea, in 1801, not far from Van Diemen's Land, at a
very little distance from his ship, <i>Le G&eacute;ographe</i>, a "Sepia,"
of the size of a barrel, rolling with noise on the waves; its
arms, between 6 and 7 feet long, and 6 or 7 inches in
diameter at the base, extended on the surface, and writhing
about like great snakes. He recognised in this, and no
doubt correctly, one of the calamaries. The arms that he
saw were evidently the animal's shorter ones, as under such
circumstances, with neither enemy to combat nor prey to
seize at the moment, the longer tentacles would remain
concealed.</p>

near the Equator, they found the remains of an enormous
calamary, half eaten by the sharks and birds, which could
not have weighed less, when entire, than 200 lbs. A portion
of this was secured, and is preserved in the Museum of
Natural History, Paris.</p>

<p>Captain Sander Rang<a name="Anchor_17_17" id="Anchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">&nbsp;[17]&nbsp;</a> records having fallen in with, in
mid-ocean, a species distinct from the others, of a dark red
colour, having short arms, and a body the size of a hogshead.</p>

<p>In a manuscript by Paulsen (referred to by Professor
Steenstrup, at a meeting of Scandinavian naturalists at
Copenhagen in 1847) is a description of a large calamary,
cast ashore on the coast of Zeeland, which the latter named
<i>Architeuthis monachus</i>. Its body measured 21 feet, and its
tentacles 18 feet, making a total of 39 feet.</p>

<p>In 1854 another was stranded at the Skag in Jutland,
which Professor Steenstrup believed to belong to the same
genus as the preceding, but to be of a different species, and
called it <i>Architeuthis dux</i>. The body was cut in pieces by
the fishermen for bait, and furnished many wheelbarrow
loads. Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys<a name="Anchor_18_18" id="Anchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">&nbsp;[18]&nbsp;</a> says Dr. M&ouml;rch informed him
that the beak of this animal was nine inches long. He adds
that another huge cephalopod was stranded in 1860 or
1861, between Hillswick and Scalloway, on the west of
Shetland. From a communication received by Professor
Allman, it appears that its tentacles were 16 feet long, the
pedal arms about half that length, and the mantle sac 7
feet. The largest suckers examined by Professor Allman
were three-quarters of an inch in diameter.</p>

VESSEL &#39;ALECTON,&#39; NEAR TENERIFFE.</span>
</div>

<p>We have also the statement of the officers and crew of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the French despatch steamer, <i>Alecton</i>, commanded by Lieutenant
Bouyer, describing their having met with a great
calamary on the 30th of November, 1861, between Madeira
and Teneriffe. It was seen about noon on that day floating
on the surface of the water, and the vessel was stopped with
a view to its capture. Many bullets were aimed at it, but
they passed through its soft flesh without doing it much
injury, until at length "the waves were observed to be
covered with foam and blood." It had probably discharged
the contents of its ink-bag; for a strong odour of
musk immediately became perceptible&mdash;a perfume which I
have already mentioned as appertaining to the ink of many
of the cephalopoda, and also as being one of the reputed
attributes of the Kraken. Harpoons were thrust into it,
but would not hold in the yielding flesh; and the animal
broke adrift from them, and, diving beneath the vessel,
came up on the other side. The crew wished to launch
a boat that they might attack it at closer quarters, but the
commander forbade this, not feeling justified in risking the
lives of his men. A rope with a running knot was, however,
slipped over it, and held fast at the junction of the broad
caudal fin; but when an attempt was made to hoist it on
deck the enormous weight caused the rope to cut through
the flesh, and all but the hinder part of the body fell back into
the sea and disappeared. M. Berthelot, the French consul at
Teneriffe, saw the fin and posterior portion of the animal on
board the <i>Alecton</i> ten days afterwards, and sent a report
of the occurrence to the Paris Academy of Sciences. The
body of this great squid, which, like Rang's specimen, was
of a deep-red colour, was estimated to have been from
16 feet to 18 feet long, without reckoning the length of its
formidable arms.<a name="Anchor_19_19" id="Anchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">&nbsp;[19]&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>These are statements made by men who, by their intelligence,
character, and position, are entitled to respect and
credence; and whose evidence would be accepted without
question or hesitation in any court of law. There is, moreover,
a remarkable coincidence of particulars in their several
accounts, which gives great importance to their combined
testimony.</p>

<p>But, fortunately, we are not left dependent on documentary
evidence alone, nor with the option of accepting
or rejecting, as caprice or prejudice may prompt us, the
narratives of those who have told us they have seen what
we have not. Portions of cuttles of extraordinary size are
preserved in several European museums. In the collection
of the Faculty of Sciences at Montpellier is one six feet
long, taken by fishermen at Cette, which Professor Steenstrup
has identified as <i>Ommastrephes pteropus</i>. One of the
same species, which was formerly in the possession of M.
Eschricht, who received it from Marseilles, may be seen in
the museum at Copenhagen. The body of another,
analogous to these, is exhibited in the Museum of Trieste:
it was taken on the coast of Dalmatia. At the meeting of
the British Association at Plymouth in 1841, Colonel Smith
exhibited drawings of the beak and other parts of a very
large calamary preserved at Haarlem; and M. P. Harting,
in 1860, described in the Memoirs of the Royal Scientific
Academy of Amsterdam portions of two extant in other
collections in Holland, one of which he believes to be Steenstrup's
<i>Architeuthis dux</i>, a species which he regards as
identical with <i>Ommastrephes todarus</i> of D'Orbigny.</p>

<p>Still there remained a residuum of doubt in the minds of
naturalists and the public concerning the existence of
gigantic cuttles until, towards the close of the year 1873,
two specimens were encountered on the coast of Newfoundland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and a portion of one and the whole of the other,
were brought ashore, and preserved for examination by
competent zoologists.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which the first was seen, as
sensationally described by the Rev. M. Harvey, Presbyterian
minister of St. John's, Newfoundland, in a letter to
Principal Dawson, of McGill College, were, briefly and
soberly, as follows:&mdash;Two fishermen were out in a small
punt on the 26th of October, 1873, near the eastern end of
Belle Isle, Conception Bay, about nine miles from St. John's.
Observing some object floating on the water at a short
distance, they rowed towards it, supposing it to be the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
of a wreck. On reaching it one of them struck it with his
"gaff," when immediately it showed signs of life, and shot
out its two tentacular arms, as if to seize its antagonists.
The other man, named Theophilus Picot, though naturally
alarmed, severed both arms with an axe as they lay on the
gunwale of the boat, whereupon the animal moved off, and
ejected a quantity of inky fluid which darkened the surrounding
water for a considerable distance. The men went
home, and, as fishermen will, magnified their lost "fish."
They "estimated" the body to have been 60 feet in length,
and 10 feet across the tail fin; and declared that when
the "fish" attacked them "it reared a parrot-like beak
which was as big as a six-gallon keg."</p>

<p>All this, in the excitement of the moment, Mr. Harvey
appears to have been willing to believe, and related without
the expression of a doubt. Fortunately, he was able to
obtain from the fishermen a portion of one of the tentacular
arms which they had chopped off with the axe, and by so
doing rendered good service to science. This fragment
(<a href="#fig_009">Fig. 9</a>), as measured by Mr. Alexander Murray, provincial
geologist of Newfoundland, and Professor Verrill, of Yale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
College, Connecticut, is 17 feet long and 3&frac12; feet in circumference.
It is now in St. John's Museum. By careful calculation
of its girth, the breadth and circumference of the
expanded sucker-bearing portion at its extremity, and the
diameter of the suckers, Professor Verrill has computed its
dimensions to have been as follows:&mdash;Length of body 10 feet;
diameter of body 2 feet 5 inches. Long tentacular arms
32 feet; head 2 feet; total length about 44 feet. The upper
mandible of the beak, instead of being "as large as a six-gallon
keg" would be about 3 inches long, and the lower
mandible 1&frac12; inch long. From the size of the large suckers
relatively to those of another specimen to be presently
described, he regards it as probable that this individual was
a female.</p>

IN CONCEPTION BAY, NEWFOUNDLAND, OCT. 26, 1873.</span>
</div>

<p>In November, 1873&mdash;about three weeks after the occurrence
in Conception Bay&mdash;another calamary somewhat
smaller than the preceding, but of the same species, also
came into Mr. Harvey's possession. Three fishermen, when
hauling their herring-net in Logie Bay, about three miles
from St. John's, found the huge animal entangled in its folds.
With great difficulty they succeeded in despatching it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
bringing it ashore, having been compelled to cut off its head
before they could get it into their boat.</p>

</div>

<p>The body of this specimen was over 7 feet long; the
caudal fin 22 inches broad; the two long tentacular arms
24 feet in length; the eight shorter arms each 6 feet long,
the largest of the latter being 10 inches in circumference at
the base; total length of this calamary 32 feet. Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Verrill considers that this and the Conception Bay squid
are both referable to one species&mdash;Steenstrup's <i>Architeuthis
dux</i>.</p>

<p>Excellent woodcuts from photographs of these two specimens
were given in the <i>Field</i> of December 13th, 1873, and
January 31st, 1874, respectively, and I am indebted to the
proprietors of that journal for their kind and courteous permission
to copy them in reduced size for the illustration of
this little work.</p>

<p>For the preservation of both of the above described
specimens we have to thank Mr. Harvey, and he produces
additional evidence of other gigantic cuttles having been
previously seen on the coast of Newfoundland. He mentions
two especially, which, as stated by the Rev. Mr.
Gabriel, were cast ashore in the winter of 1870-71, near
Lamaline on the south coast of the island, which measured
respectively 40 feet and 47 feet in length; and he also tells
of another stranded two years later, the total length of
which was 80 feet.</p>

<p>In the <i>American Journal of Science and Arts</i>, of March
1875, Professor Verrill gives particulars and authenticated
testimony of several other examples of great calamaries,
varying in total length from 30 feet to 52 feet, which have
been taken in the neighbourhood of Newfoundland since
the year 1870. One of these was found floating, apparently
dead, near the Grand Banks in October 1871, by Captain
Campbell, of the schooner <i>B. D. Hoskins</i>, of Gloucester,
Mass. It was taken on board, and part of it used for bait.
The body is stated to have been 15 feet long, and the pedal
or shorter arms between 9 feet and 10 feet. The beak was
forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<p>Another instance given by Professor Verrill is of a great
squid found alive in shallow water in Coomb's Cove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Fortune Bay, in the year 1872. Its measurements, taken by
the Hon. T. R. Bennett, of English Harbour, Newfoundland,
were, length of body 10 feet; length of tentacle 42 feet;
length of one of the ordinary arms 6 feet: the cups on the
tentacles were serrated. Professor Verrill also mentions a
pair of jaws and two suckers in the Smithsonian Institution,
as having been received from the Rev. A. Munn, with a
statement that they were taken from a calamary which
went ashore in Bonavista Bay, and which measured 32 feet
in total length.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of September, 1877, another gigantic squid
was stranded at Catalina, on the north shore of Trinity
Bay, Newfoundland, during a heavy equinoctial gale. It
was alive when first seen, but died soon after the ebbing of
the tide, and was left high and dry upon the beach. Two
fishermen took possession of it, and the whole settlement
gathered to gaze in astonishment at the monster. Formerly
it would have been converted into manure, or cut up as
food for dogs, but, thanks to the diffusion of intelligence,
there were some persons in Catalina who knew the importance
of preserving such a rarity, and who advised the
fishermen to take it to St. John's. After being exhibited
there for two days, it was packed in half-a-ton of ice in
readiness for transmission to Professor Verrill, in the hope
that it would be placed in the Peabody or Smithsonian
Museum; but at the last moment its owners violated their
agreement, and sold it to a higher bidder. The final
purchase was made for the New York Aquarium, where it
arrived on the 7th of October, immersed in methylated
spirit in a large glass tank. Its measurements were as follows:&mdash;length
of body 10 feet; length of tentacles 30 feet;
length of shorter arm 11 feet; circumference of body 7 feet;
breadth of caudal fin 2 feet 9 inches; diameter of largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
tentacular sucker 1 inch; number of suckers on each of
the shorter arms 250.</p>

<p>The appearance of so many of these great squids on
the shores of Newfoundland during the term of seven years,
and after so long a period of popular uncertainty as to
their very existence had previously elapsed, might lead one
to suppose that the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean
which wash the north-eastern coasts of the American Continent
were, at any rate, temporarily, their principal habitat,
especially as a smaller member of their family, <i>Ommastrephes
sagittatus</i>, is there found in such extraordinary
numbers that it furnishes the greater part of the bait used
in the Newfoundland cod fisheries. But that they are by
no means confined to this locality is proved by recent
instances, as well as by those already cited.</p>

<p>Dr. F. Hilgendorf records<a name="Anchor_20_20" id="Anchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">&nbsp;[20]&nbsp;</a> observations of a huge squid
exhibited for money at Yedo, Japan, in 1873, and of another
of similar size, which he saw exposed for sale in the Yedo
fish market.</p>

<p>When the French expedition was sent to the Island of
St. Paul, in 1874, for the purpose of observing the transit
of Venus, which occurred on the 9th of December in that
year, it was fortunately accompanied by an able zoologist,
M. Ch. Velain. He reports<a name="Anchor_21_21" id="Anchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">&nbsp;[21]&nbsp;</a> that on the 2nd of November
a tidal wave cast upon the north shore of the island a great
calamary which measured in total length nearly 23 feet,
namely: length of body 7 feet; length of tentacles 16 feet.
There are several points of interest connected with its
generic characters, and M. Velain's grounds for regarding
it as being of a previously unknown species, but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>are too technical for discussion here. This specimen was
photographed as it lay upon the beach by M. Cazin, the
photographer to the expedition.</p>

<p>The following account of the still more recent capture of
a large squid off the west coast of Ireland was given in the
<i>Zoologist</i> of June 1875, by Sergeant Thomas O'Connor, of
the Royal Irish Constabulary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"On the 26th of April, 1875, a very large calamary was met
with on the north-west of Boffin Island, Connemara. The crew of
a 'curragh' (a boat made like the 'coracle,' with wooden ribs
covered with tarred canvas) observed to seaward a large floating
mass, surrounded by gulls. They pulled out to it, believing it to
be wreck, but to their astonishment found it was an enormous
cuttle-fish, lying perfectly still, as if basking on the surface of the
water. Paddling up with caution, they lopped off one of its arms.
The animal immediately set out to sea, rushing through the water
at a tremendous pace. The men gave chase, and, after a hard
pull in their frail canvas craft, came up with it, five miles out in
the open Atlantic, and severed another of its arms and the head.
These portions are now in the Dublin Museum. The shorter
arms measure, each, eight feet in length, and fifteen inches round
the base: the tentacular arms are said to have been thirty feet
long. The body sank."</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, there is in our own national collection, preserved
in spirit in a tall glass jar, a single arm of a huge cephalopod,
which, by the kindness and courtesy of the officers of the
department, I was permitted to examine and measure when
I first described it, in May, 1873. It is 9 feet long, and 12
inches in circumference at the base, tapering gradually to a
fine point. It has about 300 suckers, pedunculated, or set
on tubular footstalks, placed alternately in two rows, and
having serrated, horny rings, but no hooks; the diameter
of the largest of these rings is half an inch; the smallest is
not larger than a pin's head. This is one of the eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
shorter, or pedal, and not one of the long, or tentacular,
arms of the calamary to which it belonged. The relative
length of the arms to that of the body and tentacles
varies in different genera of the <i>Teuthid&aelig;</i>, and it is not
impossible that this may be the case even in individuals
of the same species. But, judging from the proportions
of known examples, I estimate the length of the tentacles
at 36 feet, and that of the body at from 10 to
11 feet: total length 47 feet. The beak would probably
have been about 5 inches long from hinge socket to point,
and the diameter of the largest suckers of the tentacles
about 1 inch. So much for De Montfort's "suckers as big
as saucepan-lids." From a well defined fold of skin which
spreads out from each margin of that surface of the arm
over which the suckers are situated, Professor Owen has
given to this calamary the generic name of <i>Plectoteuthis</i>,
with the specific title of <i>grandis</i> to indicate its enormous
size. No history relating to this interesting specimen has
been preserved. No one knows its origin, nor when it was
received, but Dr. Gray told me that he believed it came
from the east coast of South America. It has, however,
long formed part of the stores of the British Museum, and,
although previously open to public view, was more recently
for many years kept in the basement chambers of the old
building in Bloomsbury, which were irreverently called by
the initiated "the spirit vaults and bottle department,"
because fishes, mollusca, &amp;c., preserved in spirits were
there deposited. I hope the public will have greater
facility of access to it in the new Museum.</p>

<p>Here, then, in our midst, and to be seen by all who ask
permission to inspect it, is, and has long been, a limb of a
great cephalopod capable of upsetting a boat, or of hauling
a man out of her, or of clutching one engaged in scraping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
a ship's side, and dragging him under water, as described
by the old master-mariner Magnus Dens. The tough,
supple tentacles, shot forth with lightning rapidity, would
be long enough to reach him at a distance of a dozen yards,
and strong enough to drag him within the grasp of the
eight shorter arms, a helpless victim to the mandibles of a
beak sufficiently powerful to tear him in pieces and crush
some of his smaller bones. For, once within that dreadful
embrace, his escape, unaided, would be impossible. The
clinging power of this <i>Plectoteuthis</i> is so enormously augmented
by the additional surface given by the expanded
folds to the under side of the arms, that I doubt if even
one of the smaller whales, such as the "White Whale," or
the "Pilot Whale," could extricate itself from their combined
hold, if those eight supple, clammy, adhesive arms,
each 9 feet long, and 5 inches in diameter at the base
on the flat under surface, and armed with a battery of
2400 suckers, were once fairly lapped around it.</p>

<p>Ought it to surprise us, then, that an uneducated seafaring
population, such as the fishermen of Fridrichstad,
mentioned by Pontoppidan, absolutely ignorant of the
habits and affinities, and even unacquainted with the real
external form of such a creature, should exaggerate its
dimensions and invest it with mystery? All that they
knew of it was that whilst their friends and neighbours,
whom we will call Eric Paulsen, Hans Ohlsen, and Olaf
Bruhn were out fishing one calm day, a shapeless "something"
rose just above the surface of the tranquil sea not
far from their boat. They could see that there was much
more of its bulk under water, but how far it extended they
could not ascertain. Mistrusting its appearance, and with
foreboding of danger, they were about to get up their
anchor, when, suddenly, from thirty feet away, a rope was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
shot on board which fastened itself on Hans; he was
dragged from amongst them towards the strange floating
mass; there was a commotion; from the foaming sea
upreared themselves, as it seemed to Eric and Olaf, several
writhing serpents, which twined themselves around Hans;
and as they gazed, helpless, in horror and bewilderment,
the monster sank, and with a mighty swirl the waters
closed for ever over their unfortunate companion. The
men would naturally hasten home, and describe the dreadful
incident&mdash;their imagination excited by its mysterious
nature; the tale would spread through the district, losing
nothing by repetition, and within a week the fabled Kraken
would be the result.</p>

<p>The existence, in almost every sea, of calamaries capable
of playing their part in such a scene has been fully proved,
and this vexed question of marine zoology set at rest for
ever. The "much greater light on this subject," which, as
Pontoppidan sagaciously foresaw, was "reserved for posterity,"
has been thrown upon it by the discoveries of the
last few years; and the "further experience which is
always the best instructor," and which he correctly anticipated
would be possessed by the "future writers," to whom
he bequeathed the completion of his "sketch," has been
obtained. Viewed by their aid, and seen in the clearer
atmosphere of our present knowledge, the great sea-monster
which loomed so indefinitely vast in the mist of ignorance and
superstition, stands revealed in its true form and proportions&mdash;its
magnitude reduced, its outline distinct, and its mystery
gone&mdash;and we recognise in the supposed Kraken, as the
Norwegian bishop rightly conjectured that we should, an
animal "of the Polypus (or cuttle) kind, and amongst the
largest inhabitants of the ocean."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE GREAT SEA SERPENT.</h2>


<p>The belief in the existence of sea-serpents of formidable
dimensions is of great antiquity. Aristotle, writing about
<small>B.C.</small> 340, says<a name="Anchor_22_22" id="Anchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">&nbsp;[22]&nbsp;</a>:&mdash;"The serpents of Libya are of an enormous
size. Navigators along that coast report having seen
a great quantity of bones of oxen, which they believe,
without doubt, to have been devoured by the serpents.
These serpents pursued them when they left the shore, and
upset one of their triremes"&mdash;a vessel of a large class,
having three banks of oars.</p>

<p>Pliny tells us<a name="Anchor_23_23" id="Anchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">&nbsp;[23]&nbsp;</a> that a squadron sent by Alexander the
Great on a voyage of discovery, under the command of
Onesicritus and Nearchus, encountered, in the neighbourhood
of some islands in the Persian Gulf, sea-serpents
thirty feet long, which filled the fleet with terror.</p>

<p>Valerius Maximus,<a name="Anchor_24_24" id="Anchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">&nbsp;[24]&nbsp;</a> quoting Livy, describes the alarm
into which, during the Punic wars, the Romans, under
Attilius Regulus (who was afterwards so cruelly put to
death by the Carthaginians), were thrown by an aquatic,
though not marine, serpent which had its lair on the
banks of the Bagrados, near Ithaca. It is said to have
swallowed many of the soldiers, after crushing them in
its folds, and to have kept the army from crossing the
river, till at length, being invulnerable by ordinary weapons,
it was destroyed by heavy stones hurled by balistas,
catapults, and other military engines used in those days
for casting heavy missiles, and battering the walls of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>fortified towns. According to the historian, the annoyance
caused by it to the army did not cease with its death, for
the water was polluted with its gore, and the air with the
noxious fumes from its corrupted carcase, to such a degree
that the Romans were obliged to remove their camp. They,
however secured the animal's skin and skull, which were preserved
in a temple at Rome till the time of the Numantine
war. This combat has been described, to the same effect,
by Florus (lib. ii.), Seneca (litt. 82), Silvius Italicus (l. vi.),
Aulus Gellius (lib. vi., cap. 3), Orosius, Zonaras, &amp;c., and is
referred to by Pliny (lib. viii., cap. 14) as an incident known
to every one. Diodorus Siculus also tells of a great serpent,
sixty feet long, which lived chiefly in the water, but landed
at frequent intervals to devour the cattle in its neighbourhood.
A party was collected to capture it; but their first
attempt failed, and the monster killed twenty of them. It
was afterwards taken in a strong net, carried alive to
Alexandria, and presented to King Ptolemy II., the founder
of the Alexandrian Library and Museum, who was a great
collector of zoological and other curiosities. This snake
was probably one of the great boas.</p>

<p>The "<i>Serpens marinus</i>" is figured and referred to by
many other writers, but as they evidently allude to the
Conger and the Murena, we will pass over their descriptions.</p>

<p>The sea-serpents mentioned by Aristotle, Pliny, and
Diodorus were, doubtless, real sea-snakes, true marine
ophidians, which are more common in tropical seas than is
generally supposed. They are found most abundantly in
the Indian Ocean; but they have an extensive geographical
range, and between forty and fifty species of them are
known. They are all highly poisonous, and some are so
ferocious that they more frequently attack than avoid man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
The greatest length to which they are authentically known
to attain is about twelve feet. The form and structure of
these <i>hydrophides</i> are modified from those of land serpents,
to suit their aquatic habits. The tail is compressed vertically,
flattened from the sides, so as to form a fin like the
tail of an eel, by which they propel themselves; but instead
of tapering to a point, it is rounded off at the end, like the
blade of a paper-knife, or the scabbard of a cavalry sabre.
Like other lung-breathing animals which live in water, they
are also provided with a respiratory apparatus adapted to
their circumstances and requirements&mdash;their nostrils, which
are very small, being furnished, like those of the seal,
manatee, &amp;c., with a valve opening at will to admit air, and
closing perfectly to exclude water.</p>

<p>Leaving these water-snakes of the tropics, we come,
next in order of date, upon some very remarkable evidence
that there was current amongst a community where we
should little expect to find it, the idea of a marine monster
corresponding in many respects with some of the descriptions
given several centuries later of the sea-serpent. In
an interesting article on the Catacombs of Rome in the
<i>Illustrated London News</i> of February 3rd, 1872, allusion
is made by the author to the collection of sarcophagi or
coffins of the early Christians, removed from the Catacombs,
and preserved in the museum of the Lateran Palace, where
they were arranged by the late Padre Marchi for Pope
Pius IX. There are more than twenty of these, sculptured
with various designs&mdash;the Father and the Son, Adam and
Eve and the Serpent, the Sacrifice of Abraham, Moses
striking the Rock, Daniel and the Lions, and other Scripture
themes. Amongst them also is Jonah and the "whale."
A facsimile of this sculpture (<a href="#fig_011">Fig. 11</a>) is one of the illustrations
of the article referred to. It will be seen that Jonah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
is being swallowed feet foremost, or possibly being ejected
head first, by an enormous sea monster, having the chest
and fore-legs of a horse, a long arching neck, with a mane
at its base, near the shoulders, a head like nothing in
nature, but having hair upon and beneath the cheeks, the
hinder portion of the body being that of a serpent of
prodigious length, undulating in several vertical curves.
This sculpture appears to have been cut between the
beginning and the middle of the third century, about
<small>A.D.</small> 230, but it probably represents a tradition of far
greater antiquity.</p>

<p>We will now consider the accounts given by Scandinavian
historians, of the sea-serpent having been seen in northern
waters. Here, I suppose, I ought to indulge in the usual
flippant sneer at Bishop Pontoppidan. I know that in abstaining
from doing so I am sadly out of the fashion; but I
venture to think that the dead lion has been kicked at too
often already, and undeservedly. Whether there be, or be not,
a huge marine animal, not necessarily an ophidian, answering
to some of the descriptions of the sea-serpent&mdash;so called&mdash;Pontoppidan
did not invent the stories told of its appearance.
Long before he was born the monster had been
described and figured; and for centuries previously the
Norwegians, Swedes, Danes, and Fins had believed in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
existence as implicitly as in the tenets of their religious
creed. Olaus Magnus, Archbishop of Upsala, in Sweden,
wrote of it in <small>A.D.</small> 1555 as follows:&mdash;<a name="Anchor_25_25" id="Anchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">&nbsp;[25]&nbsp;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>"They who in works of navigation on the coasts of Norway
employ themselves in fishing or merchandize do all agree in this
strange story, that there is a serpent there which is of a vast
magnitude, namely 200 foot long, and moreover, 20 foot thick;
and is wont to live in rocks and caves toward the sea-coast about
Berge: which will go alone from his holes on a clear night in
summer, and devour calves, lambs, and hogs, or else he goes into
the sea to feed on polypus (octopus), locusts (lobsters), and all
sorts of sea-crabs. He hath commonly hair hanging from his
neck a cubit long, and sharp scales, and is black, and he hath
flaming, shining eyes. This snake disquiets the shippers; and
he puts up his head on high like a pillar, and catcheth away men,
and he devours them; and this happeneth not but it signifies
some wonderful change of the kingdom near at hand; namely,
that the princes shall die, or be banished; or some tumultuous
wars shall presently follow. There is also another serpent of an
incredible magnitude in an island called Moos in the diocess of
Hammer; which, as a comet portends a change in all the world,
so that portends a change in the kingdom of Norway, as it was
seen anno 1522; that lifts himself high above the waters, and rolls
himself round like a sphere.<a name="Anchor_26_26" id="Anchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">&nbsp;[26]&nbsp;</a> This serpent was thought to be
fifty cubits long by conjecture, by sight afar off: there followed
this the banishment of King Christiernus, and a great persecution
of the Bishops; and it shewed also the destruction of the
country."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Gothic Archbishop, amongst other signs and omens,
also attributes this power of divination to the small red
ants which are sometimes so troublesome in houses, and
declares that they also portended the downfall, <small>A.D.</small> 1523,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of the abominably cruel Danish king, Christian II., above
mentioned. His curious work is full of wild improbabilities
and odd superstitions, most of which he states with a
calm air of unquestioning assent; but as he wrote in the
time of our Henry VIII., long before the belief in witches
and warlocks, fairies and banshees, had died out in our own
country, we can hardly throw stones at him on that score.
It is a most amusing and interesting history, and gives a
wonderful insight of the habits and customs of the northern
nations in his day.</p>

<p>Amongst his illustrations of the sea monsters he describes
are the two of which I give facsimiles on the next page. In
<a href="#fig_012">Fig. 12</a> a sea-serpent is seen writhing in many coils upon
the surface of the water, and having in its mouth a sailor,
whom it has seized from the deck of a ship. The poor fellow
is trying to grasp the ratlins of the shrouds, but is being
dragged from his hold and lifted over the bulwarks by the
monster. His companions, in terror, are endeavouring to
escape in various directions. One is climbing aloft by the
stay, in the hope of getting out of reach in that way,
whilst two others are hurrying aft to obtain the shelter of
a little castle or cabin projecting over the stern. I am
strongly of the opinion that this is but the fallacious representation
of an actual occurrence. Read by the light of
recent knowledge, these old pictures convey to a practised
eye a meaning as clear as that of hieroglyphics to an
Egyptologist, and my translation of this is the following:
The crew of a ship have witnessed the dreadful sight of a
serpent-like form issuing from the sea, rising over the
bulwarks of their vessel, seizing one of their messmates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
from amongst them, and dragging him overboard and
under water. Awe-stricken by the mysterious disappearance
of their comrade, and too frightened and anxious for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>their own safety to be able, during the short space of time
occupied by an affair, which all happened in a few seconds,
to observe accurately their terrible assailant, they naturally
conjecture that it must have been a snake. It was probably
a gigantic calamary, such as we now know exist,
and the dead carcases of which have been found in the
locality where the event depicted is supposed to have taken
place. The presumed body of the serpent was one of the arms
of the squid, and the two rows of suckers thereto belonging
are indicated in the illustration by the medial line traversing
its whole length (intended to represent a dorsal fin) and
the double row of transverse septa, one on each side of it.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 13.&mdash;A GIGANTIC LOBSTER DRAGGING A MAN FROM A SHIP.

After Olaus Magnus.</span>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 13 an enormous lobster is in the act of similarly
dragging overboard from a vessel a man whom it has seized
by the arm with one of its great claws. From the crude
image of a lobster having eight minor claws and two larger
ones, to that of a cuttle having eight minor arms and two
longer ones, the transition is not great; and I believe that
this also is a pictorial misrepresentation of a casualty
by the attack of a calamary similar to that above described,
possibly another view of the same incident. The
idea is that of a sea animal capable of suddenly seizing and
grasping a man, and we must remember that we have
evidence, in the writings of Pontoppidan and others, that,
even two centuries later than Olaus Magnus, the Norsemen's
knowledge of the cuttles was exceedingly vague and
indistinct. Any one who has seen, as I frequently have at
the Brighton Aquarium, and as they doubtless had whilst
lobster-catching, the threatening and ferocious manner in
which a lobster will brandish, and, if I may use the term,
"gnash" its claws at an intruding hand, even if held above
the surface of the water, can well imagine a party of fishermen
discussing such a tragic occurrence as the foregoing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and differing in opinion as to the identity of the creature
which had caused the catastrophe, some maintaining that it
must have been a sea-serpent, and others shaking their
heads and asserting that nothing but a colossal lobster
could have done it.</p>

<p>Pontoppidan, in writing his history of Norway, of course
had before him the statements of Olaus Magnus; but, though
their author was an archbishop, he did not accept them
with the childlike simplicity generally ascribed to him.
Quoting, and, singularly enough, misquoting, the Swedish
prelate as referring to a sea-serpent, when he is describing,
incorrectly, one of the <i>Acaleph&aelig;</i>, or sea-nettles, Pontoppidan
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have never heard of this sort, and should hardly believe
the good Olaus if he did not say that he affirmed this from his
own experience. The disproportion makes me think there must
be some error of the press.... He mixes truth and fable together
according to the relations of others; but this was excusable in
that dark age when that author wrote. Notwithstanding all this,
we, in the present more enlightened age, are much obliged to him
for his industry and judicious observations."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the sea-serpent Pontoppidan writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have questioned its existence myself, till that suspicion was
removed by full and sufficient evidence from creditable and experienced
fishermen and sailors in Norway, of which there are hundreds
who can testify that they have annually seen them. All
these persons agree very well in the general description; and
others who acknowledge that they only know it by report or by
what their neighbours have told them, still relate the same particulars.
In all my inquiry about these affairs I have hardly spoke
with any intelligent person born in the manor of Nordland who
was not able to give a pertinent answer, and strong assurances of
the existence of this fish; and some of our north traders that
come here every year with their merchandize think it a very strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
question when they are seriously asked whether there be any such
creature: they think it as ridiculous as if the question was put to
them whether there be such fish as eel or cod."</p></blockquote>

<p>The worthy Bishop of Bergen did his best to sift truth
from fable, but he could not always succeed in separating
them. Many stupendous falsehoods were brought to him,
and some of them passed through his sieve in spite of his
care. Of these are the accounts of the "spawning times"
of the sea-serpent, its dislike of certain scents, &amp;c. We
must pass over all this, and confine ourselves to the
evidence offered by him of its having been seen.</p>

<p>The first witness he adduces is Captain Lawrence de
Ferry, of the Norwegian navy, and first pilot in Bergen,
who, premising that he had doubted a great while whether
there were any such creature till he had ocular demonstration
of it, made the following statement, addressed formally
and officially to the procurator of Bergen:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">John Reutz</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"The latter end of August, in the year 1746, as I was on a
voyage, on my return from Trundhiem, on a very calm and hot
day, having a mind to put in at Molde, it happened that when
we were arrived with my vessel within six English miles of
the aforesaid Molde, being at a place called Jule-N&aelig;ss, as
I was reading in a book, I heard a kind of a murmuring
voice from amongst the men at the oars, who were eight in
number, and observed that the man at the helm kept off from
the land. Upon this I inquired what was the matter, and was
informed that there was a sea-snake before us. I then ordered
the man at the helm to keep to the land again, and to come up
with this creature of which I had heard so many stories. Though
the fellows were under some apprehension, they were obliged to
obey my orders. In the meantime the sea-snake passed by us,
and we were obliged to tack the vessel about in order to get nearer
to it. As the snake swam faster than we could row, I took my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
gun, that was ready charged, and fired at it; on this he immediately
plunged under the water. We rowed to the place where
it sunk down (which in the calm might be easily observed) and
lay upon our oars, thinking it would come up again to the surface;
however it did not. Where the snake plunged down, the water
appeared thick and red; perhaps some of the shot might wound it,
the distance being very little. The head of this snake, which it held
more than two feet above the surface of the water, resembled that
of a horse. It was of a greyish colour, and the mouth was quite
black, and very large. It had black eyes, and a long white mane,
that hung down from the neck to the surface of the water.
Besides the head and neck, we saw seven or eight folds, or coils,
of this snake, which were very thick, and as far as we could guess
there was about a fathom distance between each fold. I related
this affair in a certain company, where there was a person of distinction
present who desired that I would communicate to him an
authentic detail of all that happened; and for this reason two of
my sailors, who were present at the same time and place where I
saw this monster, namely, Nicholas Pedersen Kopper, and Nicholas
Nicholsen Anglewigen, shall appear in court, to declare on oath
the truth of every particular herein set forth; and I desire the
favour of an attested copy of the said descriptions.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 14.&mdash;PONTOPPIDAN&#39;S
&quot;SEA SERPENT.&quot;</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>The figure of the sea-serpent (Fig. 14) given by Pontoppidan
was drawn, he tells us, under the inspection of a
clergyman, Mr. Hans Strom, from
descriptions given of it by two of
his neighbours, Messrs. Reutz and
Teuchsen, of Herroe; and was declared
to agree in every particular
with that seen by Captain de Ferry,
and another subsequently observed
by Governor Benstrup. The supposed
coils of the serpent's body
present exactly the appearance of
eight porpoises following each other
in line. This is a well-known habit
of some of the smaller cetacea.
They are often met with at sea
thus proceeding in close single file,
part only of their rotund forms
being visible as they raise their
backs above the surface of the
water to inhale air through their
"blow-holes." Under these circumstances
they have been described
by naturalists and seamen as resembling
a long string of casks or
buoys, often extending for sixty,
eighty, or a hundred yards. This
is just such a spectacle as that
described by Olaus Magnus&mdash;his
"long line of spherical convolutions,"
and also as one reported
to Pontoppidan as being descriptive of the sea-serpent:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p><blockquote><p>"'I have been informed,' he says, 'by some of our sea-faring
men that a cable<a name="Anchor_27_27" id="Anchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">&nbsp;[27]&nbsp;</a> would not be long enough to measure the
length of some of them when they are observed on the surface of
the water in an even line. They say those round lumps or folds
sometimes lie one after another as far as a man can see. I
confess, if this be true, that we must suppose most probably that
it is not one snake, but two or more of these creatures lying in
a line that exhibit this phenomenon.' In a foot-note he adds:
'If any one enquires how many folds may be counted on a sea-snake,
the answer is that the number is not always the same, but
depends upon the various sizes of them: five and twenty is the
greatest number that I find well attested.' Adam Olearius, in his
Gottorf Museum, writes of it thus: 'A person of distinction from
Sweden related here at Gottorf that he had heard the burgomaster
of Malmoe, a very worthy man, say that as he was once standing
on the top of a very high hill, towards the North Sea, he saw in
the water, which was very calm, a snake, which appeared at that
distance to be as thick as a pipe of wine, and had twenty-five
folds. Those kind of snakes only appear at certain times, and
in calm weather.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>I believe that in every case so far cited from Pontoppidan,
as well as that given by Olaus Magnus, the supposed coils
or protuberances of the serpent's body, were only so many
porpoises swimming in line in accordance with their habit
before mentioned. If an upraised head, like that of a horse,
was seen preceding them, it was either unconnected with
them, or it certainly was not that of a snake; for no serpent
could throw its body into those vertical undulations.
The form of the vertebr&aelig; in the ophidians renders such a
movement impossible. All their flexions are horizontal;
the curving of their body is from side to side, not up and
down.</p>

<p>The sea-monster seen by Egede was of an entirely different
kind; and his account of it&mdash;let sceptics deride it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>as they may&mdash;is worthy of attention and careful consideration.
The Rev. Hans Egede, known as "The Apostle of
Greenland," was superintendent of the Christian missions to
that country. He was a truthful, pious, and single-minded
man, possessing considerable powers of observation, and a
genuine love of natural history. He wrote two books on
the products, people, and natural history of Greenland,<a name="Anchor_28_28" id="Anchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">&nbsp;[28]&nbsp;</a>
and his statements therein are modest, accurate, and free
from exaggeration. His illustrations are little, if at all,
superior in style of art to the two Japanese wood-cuts
shown on <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>, but they bear the same unmistakable
signs of fidelity which characterise those of the Japanese.</p>

<p>In his 'Journal of the Missions to Greenland' this author
tell us that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"On the 6th of July, 1734, there appeared a very large and
frightful sea monster, which raised itself so high out of the water
that its head reached above our main-top. It had a long, sharp
snout, and spouted water like a whale; and very broad flappers.
The body seemed to be covered with scales, and the skin was
uneven and wrinkled, and the lower part was formed like a snake.
After some time the creature plunged backwards into the water,
and then turned its tail up above the surface, a whole ship-length
from the head. The following evening we had very bad weather."</p></blockquote>

<p>The high character of the narrator would lead us to
accept his statement that he had seen something previously
unknown to him (he does not say it was a sea-serpent)
even if we could not explain or understand what it was
that he saw. Fortunately, however, the sketch made by
Mr. Bing, one of his brother missionaries, has enabled us to
do this. We must remember that in his endeavour to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
portray the incident he was dealing with an animal with
the nature of which he was unacquainted, and which was
only partially, and for a very short time, within his view.
He therefore delineated rather the impression left on his
mind than the thing itself. But although he invested it
with a character that did not belong to it, his drawing is so
far correct that we are able to recognise at a glance the
distorted portrait of an old acquaintance, and to say unhesitatingly
that Egede's sea-monster was one of the great
calamaries which have since been occasionally met with,
but which have only been believed in and recognised within
the last few years. That which Mr. Egede believed to be
the creature's head was the tail part of the cuttle, which
goes in advance as the animal swims, and the two side
appendages represent very efficiently the two lobes of the
caudal fin. In propelling itself to the surface the squid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
raised this portion of its body out of the water to a considerable
height, an occurrence which I have often witnessed, and
which I have elsewhere described (see pp. 23 and 27). The
supposed tail, which was turned up at some distance from
the other visible portion of the body, after the latter had sunk
back into the sea, was one of the shorter arms of the cuttle, and
the suckers on its under side are clearly and conspicuously
marked. Egede was, of course, in error in making the
"spout" of water to issue from the mouth of his monster.
The out-pouring jet, which he, no doubt, saw, came from
the locomotor tube, and the puff of spray which would
accompany it as the orifice of the tube rose to the surface
of the water is sketched with remarkable truthfulness. In
quoting Egede, Pontoppidan gives a copy (so-called) of this
engraving, but his artist embellished it so much as to
deprive it of its original force and character, and of the
honestly drawn points which furnish proofs of its identity.</p>

<p>Pontoppidan records other supposed appearances of the
sea-serpent, but from the date of his history I know of no
other account of such an occurrence until that of an animal
"apparently belonging to this class," which was stranded
on the Island of Stronsa, one of the Orkneys, in the year
1808:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"According to the narrative, it was first seen entire, and
measured by respectable individuals. It measured fifty-six feet
in length, and twelve in circumference. The head was small, not
being a foot long from the snout to the first vertebra; the neck
was slender, extending to the length of fifteen feet. All the witnesses
agree in assigning it blow-holes, though they differ as to the
precise situation. On the shoulders something like a bristly mane
commenced which extended to near the extremity of the tail. It
had three pairs of fins or paws connected with the body; the
anterior were the largest, measuring more than four feet in length,
and their extremities were something like toes partially webbed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
The skin was smooth and of a greyish colour; the eye was of
the size of a seal's. When the decaying carcass was broken up
by the waves, portions of it were secured (such as the skull, the
upper bones of the swimming paws, &amp;c.) by Mr. Laing, a neighbouring
proprietor, and some of the vertebr&aelig; were preserved and
deposited in the Royal University Museum, Edinburgh, and in
the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. An
able paper," says Dr. Robert Hamilton, in his account of it,<a name="Anchor_29_29" id="Anchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">&nbsp;[29]&nbsp;</a> "on
these latter fragments and on the wreck of the animal was read
by the late Dr. Barclay to the Wernerian Society, and will be
found in Vol. I. of its Transactions, to which we refer. We have
supplied a wood-cut of the sketch" (of which I give a <i>facsimile</i>
here) "which was taken at the time, and which, from the many
affidavits proffered by respectable individuals, as well as from
other circumstances narrated, leaves no manner of doubt as to the
existence of some such animal."</p></blockquote>

<p>Well! one would think so. It looks convincing, and
there is a savour of philosophy about it that might lull
the suspicions of a doubting zoologist. What more could
be required? We have accurate measurements and a
sketch taken of the animal as it lay upon the shore, minute
particulars of its outward form, characteristic portions of
its skeleton preserved in well-known museums, and any
amount of affidavits forthcoming from most respectable
individuals if confirmation be required. And yet,</p>

<p>the whole fabric of circumstances crumbled at the touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of science. When the two vertebr&aelig; in the Museum of the
Royal College of Surgeons were examined by Sir Everard
Home he pronounced them to be those of a great shark of
the genus <i>Selache</i>, and as being undistinguishable from
those of the species called the "basking shark," of which
individuals from thirty to thirty-five feet in length have been
from time to time captured or stranded on our coasts. Professor
Owen has confirmed this. Any one who feels inclined
to dispute the identification by this distinguished
comparative anatomist of a bone which he has seen and
handled can examine these vertebr&aelig; for himself. If they
had not been preserved, this incident would have been cited
for all time as among the most satisfactorily authenticated
instances on record of the appearance of the sea-serpent.
As it is, it furnishes a valuable warning of the necessity for
the most careful scrutiny of the evidence of well-meaning
persons to whom no intentional deception or exaggeration
can be imputed.</p>

<p>In 1809, Mr. Maclean, the minister of Eigg, in the Western
Isles of Scotland, informed Dr. Neill, the secretary of the
Wernerian Society, that he had seen, off the Isle of Canna,
a great animal which chased his boat as he hurried ashore
to escape from it; and that it was also seen by the crews
of thirteen fishing-boats, who were so terrified by it that
they fled from it to the nearest creek for safety. His description
of it is exceedingly vague, but is strongly indicative
of a great calamary.</p>

<p>In 1817 a large marine animal, supposed to be a serpent,
was seen at Gloucester Harbour, near Cape Ann, Massachusetts,
about thirty miles from Boston. The Linn&aelig;an
Society of New England investigated the matter, and took
much trouble to obtain evidence thereon. The depositions
of eleven credible witnesses were certified on oath before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
magistrates, one of whom had himself seen the creature,
and who confirmed the statements. All agreed that the
animal had the appearance of a serpent, but estimated its
length, variously, at from fifty to a hundred feet. Its head
was in shape like that of a turtle, or snake, but as large
as the head of a horse. There was no appearance of a
mane. Its mode of progressing was by vertical undulations;
and five of the witnesses described it as having the hunched
protuberances mentioned by Captain de Ferry and others.
Of this, I can offer no zoological explanation. The testimony
given was apparently sincere, but it was received
with mistrust; for, as Mr. Gosse says, "owing to a habit
prevalent in the United States of supposing that there is
somewhat of wit in gross exaggeration or hoaxing invention,
we do naturally look with a lurking suspicion
on American statements when they describe unusual or
disputed phenomena."</p>

<p>On the 15th of May, 1833, a party of British officers,
consisting of Captain Sullivan, Lieutenants Maclachlan and
Malcolm of the Rifle Brigade, Lieutenant Lister of the
Artillery, and Mr. Ince of the Ordnance, whilst crossing
Margaret's Bay in a small yacht, on their way from Halifax
to Mahone Bay, "saw, at a distance of a hundred and fifty
to two hundred yards, the head and neck of some denizen
of the deep, precisely like those of a common snake in the
act of swimming, the head so far elevated and thrown
forward by the curve of the neck, as to enable them to see
the water under and beyond it. The creature rapidly
passed, leaving a regular wake, from the commencement of
which to the fore part, which was out of water, they judged
its length to be about eighty feet." They "set down the
head at about six feet in length (considerably larger than
that of a horse), and that portion of the neck which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
saw at the same." "There could be no mistake&mdash;no delusion,"
they say; "and we were all perfectly satisfied that we
had been favoured with a view of the true and veritable
sea-serpent." This account was published in the <i>Zoologist</i>,
in 1847 (p. 1715), and at that date all the officers above
named were still living.</p>

<p>The next incident of the kind in point of date that we
find recorded carries us back to the locality of which
Pontoppidan wrote, and in which was seen the animal
vouched for by Captain de Ferry. In 1847 there appeared
in a London daily paper a long account translated from
the Norse journals of fresh appearances of the sea-serpent.
The statement made was, that it had recently been
frequently seen in the neighbourhood of Christiansand
and Molde. In the large bight of the sea at Christiansand
it had been seen every year, only in the warmest weather,
and when the sea was perfectly calm, and the surface of
the water unruffled. The evidence of three respectable
persons was taken, namely, Nils Roe, a workman at Mr.
William Knudtzon's, who saw it twice there, John Johnson,
merchant, and Lars John&ouml;en, fisherman at Smolen. The
latter said he had frequently seen it, and that one afternoon
in the dog-days, as he was sitting in his boat, he saw it
twice in the course of two hours, and quite close to him.
It came, indeed, to within six feet of him, and, becoming
alarmed, he commended his soul to God, and lay down in
the boat, only holding his head high enough to enable him
to observe the monster. It passed him, disappeared, and
returned; but, a breeze springing up, it sank, and he saw
it no more. He described it as being about six fathoms
long, the body (which was as round as a serpent's) two feet
across, the head as long as a ten-gallon cask, the eyes
large, round, red, sparkling, and about five inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
diameter: close behind the head a mane like a fin commenced
along the neck, and spread itself out on both sides,
right and left, when swimming. The mane, as well as the
head, was of the colour of mahogany. The body was
quite smooth, its movements occasionally fast and slow.
It was serpent-like, and moved up and down. The few
undulations which those parts of the body and tail that
were out of water made, were scarcely a fathom in length.
These undulations were not so high that he could see
between them and the water.</p>

<p>In confirmation of this account Mr. Soren Knudtzon,
Dr. Hoffmann, surgeon in Molde, Rector Hammer, Mr.
Kraft, curate, and several other persons, testified that they
had seen in the neighbourhood of Christiansand a sea-serpent
of considerable size.</p>

<p>Mr. William Knudtzon, and Mr. Bochlum, a candidate
for holy orders, also gave their account of it, much to the
same purport; but some of these remarks are worthy of
note for future comment. They say, "its motions were in
undulations, and so strong that white foam appeared before
it, and at the side, which stretched out several fathoms.
It did not appear very high out of the water; the head
was long and small in proportion to the throat: as the
latter appeared much greater than the former, probably it
was furnished with a mane."</p>

<p>Sheriffe G&ouml;ttsche testified to a similar effect. "He
could not judge of the animal's entire length; he could
not observe its extremity. At the back of the head there
was a mane, which was the same colour as the rest of the
body."</p>

<p>We must take one more Norwegian account, for it is
a very important one. The venerable P. W. Deinbolt,<a name="Anchor_30_30" id="Anchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">&nbsp;[30]&nbsp;</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>Archdeacon of Molde, gives the following account of an
incident that occurred there on the 28th of July, 1845:</p>

<blockquote><p>"J. C. Lund, bookseller and printer; G. S. Krogh, merchant;
Christian Flang, Lund's apprentice, and John Elgenses, labourer,
were out on Romsdal-fjord, fishing. The sea was, after a warm,
sunshiny day, quite calm. About seven o'clock in the afternoon,
at a little distance from the shore, near the ballast place and
Molde Hooe, they saw a long marine animal, which slowly moved
itself forward, as it appeared to them, with the help of two fins,
on the fore-part of the body nearest the head, which they judged
by the boiling of the water on both sides of it. The visible part
of the body appeared to be between forty and fifty feet in length,
and moved in undulations, like a snake. The body was round
and of a dark colour, and seemed to be several ells in thickness.
As they discerned a waving motion in the water behind the animal,
they concluded that part of the body was concealed under water.
That it was one continuous animal they saw plainly from its movement.
When the animal was about one hundred yards from the
boat, they noticed tolerably correctly its fore parts, which ended
in a sharp snout; its colossal head raised itself above the water
in the form of a semi-circle; the lower part was not visible. The
colour of the head was dark-brown and the skin smooth; they
did not notice the eyes, or any mane or bristles on the throat.
When the serpent came about a musket-shot near, Lund fired
at it, and was certain the shots hit it in the head. After the
shot it dived, but came up immediately. It raised its neck in the
air, like a snake preparing to dart on his prey. After he had
turned and got his body in a straight line, which he appeared to
do with great difficulty, he darted like an arrow against the boat.
They reached the shore, and the animal, perceiving it had come
into shallow water, dived immediately and disappeared in the
deep. Such is the declaration of these four men, and no one has
cause to question their veracity, or imagine that they were so
seized with fear that they could not observe what took place so
near them. There are not many here, or on other parts of the
Norwegian coast, who longer doubt the existence of the sea-serpent.
The writer of this narrative was a long time sceptical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
as he had not been so fortunate as to see this monster of the
deep; but after the many accounts he has read, and the relations
he has received from credible witnesses, he does not dare longer
to doubt the existence of the sea-serpent.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We may at once accept most fully and frankly the
statements of all the worthy people mentioned in this
series of incidents. There is no room for the shadow of a
doubt that they all recounted conscientiously that which
they saw. The last quoted occurrence, especially, is most
accurately and intelligently described&mdash;so clearly, indeed,
that it furnishes us with a clue to the identity of the
strange visitant.</p>

<p>Here let me say&mdash;and I wish it to be distinctly understood&mdash;that
I do not deny the possibility of the existence
of a great sea serpent, or other great creatures at present
unknown to science, and that I have no inclination to
explain away that which others have seen, because I
myself have not witnessed it. "Seeing is believing," it is
said, and it is not agreeable to have to tell a person that, in
common parlance, he "must not trust his own eyes." It
seems presumptuous even to hint that one may know
better what was seen than the person who saw it. And
yet I am obliged to say, reluctantly and courteously, but
most firmly and assuredly, that these perfectly credible
eye-witnesses did not correctly interpret that which they
witnessed. In these cases, it is not the eye which deceives,
nor the tongue which is untruthful, but the imagination
which is led astray by the association of the thing seen with
an erroneous idea. I venture to say this, not with any
insolent assumption of superior acumen, but because we
now possess a key to the mystery which Archdeacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Deinbolt and his neighbours had not access to, and which
has only within the last few years been placed in our
hands. The movements and aspect of their sea monster
are those of an animal with which we are now well
acquainted, but of the existence of which the narrators
of these occasional visitations were unaware; namely, the
great calamary, the same which gave rise to the stories of
the Kraken, and which has probably been a denizen of the
Scandinavian seas and fjords from time immemorial. It
must be remembered, as I have elsewhere said, that until
the year 1873, notwithstanding the adventure of the
<i>Alecton</i> in 1861, a cuttle measuring in total length fifty
or sixty feet was generally looked upon as equally
mythical with the great sea-serpent. Both were popularly
scoffed at, and to express belief in either was to incur
ridicule. But in the year above mentioned, specimens of
even greater dimensions than those quoted were met with
on the coasts of Newfoundland, and portions of them were
deposited in museums, to silence the incredulous and
interest zoologists. When Archdeacon Deinbolt published
in 1846 the declaration of Mr. Lund and his companions
of the fishing excursion, he and they knew nothing of there
being such an animal. They had formed no conception of
it, nor had they the instructive privilege, possessed of late
years by the public in England, of being able to watch
attentively, and at leisure, the habits and movements of
these strangely modified mollusks living in great tanks of
sea-water in aquaria. If they had been thus acquainted
with them, I believe they would have recognised in their
supposed snake the elongated body of a giant squid.</p>

</a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 18.&mdash;A CALAMARY SWIMMING AT THE SURFACE OF THE SEA.</span>
</div>

<p>When swimming, these squids propel themselves backwards
by the out-rush of a stream of water from a tube
pointed in a direction contrary to that in which the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
is proceeding. The tail part, therefore, goes in advance,
and the body tapers towards this, almost
to a blunt point. At a short
distance from the actual extremity two
flat fins project from the body, one
on each side, as shown in Figs. 16
and 18, so that this end of the squid's
body somewhat resembles in shape
the government "broad arrow." It
is a habit of these squids, the small
species of which are met with in some
localities in teeming abundance, to swim
on the smooth surface of the water in
hot and calm weather. The arrow-headed
tail is then raised out of water,
to a height which in a large individual
might be three feet or more; and, as it
precedes the rest of the body, moving
at the rate of several miles an hour, it
of course looks, to a person who has
never heard of an animal going tail first
at such a speed, like the creature's head.
The appearance of this "head" varies
in accordance with the lateral fins being
seen in profile or in broad expanse. The
elongated, tubular-looking body gives the
idea of the neck to which the "head"
is attached; the eight arms trailing behind
(the tentacles are always coiled
away and concealed) supply the supposed
mane floating on each side; the
undulating motion in swimming, as the
water is alternately drawn in and expelled, accords with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the description, and the excurrent stream pouring aft
from the locomotor tube, causes a long swirl and swell to
be left in the animal's wake, which, as I have often seen,
may easily be mistaken for an indefinite prolongation of
its body. The eyes are very large and prominent, and
the general tone of colour varies through every tint of
brown, purple, pink, and grey, as the creature is more or
less excited, and the pigmentary matter circulates with
more or less vigour through the curiously moving cells.</p>

<p>Here we have the "long marine animal" with "two fins
on the forepart of the body near the head," the "boiling of
the water," the "moving in undulations," the "body round,
and of a dark colour," the "waving motion in the water
behind the animal, from which the witnesses concluded
that part of the body was concealed under water," the
"head raised, but the lower part not visible," "the sharp
snout," the "smooth skin," and the appearance described
by Mr. William Knudtzon, and Candidatus Theologi&aelig;
Bochlum, of "the head being long and small in proportion
to the throat, the latter appearing much greater than the
former," which caused them to think "it was <i>probably</i> furnished
with a mane." Not that they <i>saw</i> any mane, but
as they had been told of it, they thought they <i>ought to have
seen it</i>. Less careful and conscientious persons would have
persuaded themselves, and declared on oath, that they
<i>did see it</i>.</p>

<p>I need scarcely point out how utterly irreconcileable is
the proverbially smooth, gliding motion of a serpent, with
the supposition of its passage through the water causing
such frictional disturbance that "white foam appeared
before it, and at the side, which stretched out several
fathoms," and of "the water boiling around it on both sides
of it." The cuttle is the only animal that I know of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
would cause this by the effluent current from its "syphon
tube." I have seen a deeply laden ship push in front of
her a vast hillock of water, which fell off on each side in
foam as it was parted by her bow; but that was of man's
construction. Nature builds on better lines. No swimming
creature has such unnecessary friction to overcome. Even
the seemingly unwieldy body of a porpoise enters and
passes through the water without a splash, and nothing can
be more easy and graceful than the feathering action of the
flippers of the awkward-looking turtle.</p>

<p>We now come to an incident which, from the character
of those who witnessed it, immediately commanded attention,
and excited popular curiosity. In the <i>Times</i> of
the 9th of October, 1848, appeared a paragraph stating
that a sea-serpent had been met with by the <i>D&aelig;dalus</i>
frigate, on her homeward voyage from the East Indies.
The Admiralty immediately inquired of her commander,
Captain M'Quh&aelig;, as to the truth of the report; and
his official reply, as follows, addressed to Admiral Sir
W. H. Gage, G.C.H., Devonport, was printed in the <i>Times</i>
of the 13th of October, 1848.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"H.M.S. <i>D&aelig;dalus</i>, Hamoaze,<br />
"October 11th, 1848.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In reply to your letter of this date, requiring information
as to the truth of the statement published in the <i>Times</i> newspaper,
of a sea-serpent of extraordinary dimensions having been seen
from H.M.S. <i>D&aelig;dalus</i>, under my command, on her passage from
the East Indies, I have the honour to acquaint you, for the information
of my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that at 5
o'clock <small>P.M.</small> on the 6th of Aug. last, in lat. 24&deg; 44' S. and long.
9&deg; 22' E., the weather dark and cloudy, wind fresh from the N.W.
with a long ocean swell from the W., the ship on the port tack,
head being N.E. by N., something very unusual was seen by Mr.
Sartoris, midshipman, rapidly approaching the ship from before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the beam. The circumstance was immediately reported by him
to the officer of the watch, Lieut. Edgar Drummond, with whom
and Mr. Wm. Barrett, the Master, I was at the time walking the
quarter-deck. The ship's company were at supper. On our
attention being called to the object it was discovered to be an
enormous serpent, with head and shoulders kept about four feet
constantly above the surface of the sea, and, as nearly as we could
approximate by comparing it with the length of what our main-topsail
yard would show in the water, there was at the very least
sixty feet of the animal <i>&agrave; fleur d'eau</i>, no portion of which was, to
our perception, used in propelling it through the water, either by
vertical or horizontal undulation. It passed rapidly, but so close
under our lee quarter that had it been a man of my acquaintance
I should easily have recognised his features with the naked eye;
and it did not, either in approaching the ship or after it had
passed our wake, deviate in the slightest degree from its course
to the S.W., which it held on at the pace of from twelve to
fifteen miles per hour, apparently on some determined purpose.</p>

<p>"The diameter of the serpent was about fifteen or sixteen
inches behind the head, which was without any doubt that of a
snake; and it was never, during the twenty minutes it continued
in sight of our glasses, once below the surface of the water; its
colour dark brown, and yellowish white about the throat. It had
no fins, but something like the mane of a horse, or rather a bunch
of seaweed, washed about its back. It was seen by the quartermaster,
the boatswain's mate, and the man at the wheel, in
addition to myself and the officers above mentioned.</p>

<p>"I am having a drawing of the serpent made from a sketch
taken immediately after it was seen, which I hope to have ready
for transmission to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty by
to-morrow's post.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Peter M'Quh&aelig;</span>, Captain."</p></blockquote>

<p>The sketches referred to in the captain's letter were
made under his supervision, and copies of them, of which
he certified his approbation, were published in the <i>Illustrated
London News</i> on the 28th of October, 1848. I am kindly
permitted by the proprietors of that journal to reproduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>

showing the relative positions of the "serpent" and the
ship when the former was first seen (<i>Frontispiece</i>), and the
other (Fig. 19) representing the animal afterwards passing
under the frigate's quarter. An enlarged drawing of its
head was also given, which I have not thought it necessary
to copy.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Drummond, the officer of the watch mentioned
in Captain M'Quh&aelig;'s report, published his memorandum
of the impression made on his mind by the
animal at the time of its appearance. It differs somewhat
from the captain's description, and is the more cautious of
the two.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I beg to send you the following extract from my journal.
H.M.S. 'D&aelig;dalus,' August 6, 1848, lat. 25&deg; S., long. 9&deg; 37' E., St.
Helena 1,015 miles. In the 4 to 6 watch, at about 5 o'clock,
we observed a most remarkable fish on our lee-quarter, crossing
the stern in a S.W. direction. The appearance of its head, which
with the back fin was the only portion of the animal visible, was
long, pointed and flattened at the top, perhaps ten feet in length,
the upper jaw projecting considerably; the fin was perhaps 20 feet
in the rear of the head, and visible occasionally; the captain also
asserted that he saw the tail, or another fin, about the same distance
behind it; the upper part of the head and shoulders appeared
of a dark brown colour, and beneath the under-jaw a brownish-white.
It pursued a steady undeviating course, keeping its head
horizontal with the surface of the water, and in rather a raised
position, disappearing occasionally beneath a wave for a very brief
interval, and not apparently for purposes of respiration. It was
going at the rate of perhaps from twelve to fourteen miles an hour,
and when nearest was perhaps one hundred yards distant; in fact
it gave one quite the idea of a large snake or eel. No one in the
ship has ever seen anything similar; so it is at least extraordinary.
It was visible to the naked eye for five minutes, and with a glass
for perhaps fifteen more. The weather was dark and squally at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the time, with some sea running.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edgar Drummond</span>, Lieut.
H.M.S. 'D&aelig;dalus;' Southampton, Oct. 28, 1848."</p></blockquote>

<p>Statements so interesting and important, of course,
elicited much correspondence and controversy. Mr. J. D.
Morries Stirling, a director of the Bergen Museum, wrote
to the Secretary of the British Admiralty, Captain
Hamilton, R.N., saying that while becalmed in a yacht
between Bergen and Sogne, in Norway, he had seen, three
years previously, a large fish or reptile of cylindrical form
(he would not say "sea serpent") ruffling the otherwise
smooth surface of the fjord. No head was visible. This
appears to have been, like the others from the same
locality, a large calamary. Mr. Stirling unaware, doubtless,
that Mr. Edward Newman, editor of the <i>Zoologist</i>,
had previously propounded the same idea, suggested that
the supposed serpent might be one of the old marine
reptiles, hitherto supposed only to exist in the fossil state.
This letter was published in the <i>Illustrated News</i> of October
28th, and four days afterwards, November 2nd, a
letter signed F.G.S. appeared in the <i>Times</i>, in which the
same idea was mooted, and the opinion expressed that it
might be the <i>Plesiosaurus</i>. This brought out that great
master in physiology, Professor Owen, who in a long, and,
it is needless to say, most able letter to the <i>Times</i>, dated
the 9th of November, 1848, set forth a series of weighty
arguments against belief in the supposed serpent, which
I regret that I am unable, from want of space, to quote
<i>in extenso</i>. The reasoning of the most eminent of living
physiologists of course had its influence on those who
could best appreciate it; but, as it went against the
current of popular opinion, it met with little favour from
the public, and has been slurred over much too superciliously
by some subsequent writers. He suggested also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
that the creature seen might have been a great seal, such
as the leonine seal, or the sea-elephant (the head, as
shown in the enlarged drawing, was wonderfully seal-like),
but it was generally felt that this explanation was unsatisfactory.
The nature of his criticism of the official
statement will be seen from Captain M'Quh&aelig;'s reply,
which was promptly given in the <i>Times</i> of the 21st of
November, 1848, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Professor Owen correctly states that I evidently saw a large
creature moving rapidly through the water very different from
anything I had before witnessed, neither a whale, a grampus, a
great shark, an alligator, nor any of the larger surface-swimming
creatures fallen in with in ordinary voyages. I now assert&mdash;neither
was it a common seal nor a sea-elephant, its great length and its
totally differing physiognomy precluding the possibility of its being
a '<i>Phoca</i>' of any species. The head was flat, and not a 'capacious
vaulted cranium;' nor had it a stiff, inflexible trunk&mdash;a
conclusion at which Professor Owen has jumped, most certainly
not justified by the simple statement, that no portion of the sixty
feet seen by us was used in propelling it through the water either
by vertical or horizontal undulation.</p>

<p>"It is also assumed that the 'calculation of its length was made
under a strong preconception of the nature of the beast;' another
conclusion quite contrary to the fact. It was not until after the
great length was developed by its nearest approach to the ship,
and until after that most important point had been duly considered
and debated, as well as such could be in the brief space of time
allowed for so doing, that it was pronounced to be a serpent by all
who saw it, and who are too well accustomed to judge of lengths
and breadths of objects in the sea to mistake a real substance and
an actual living body, coolly and dispassionately contemplated, at
so short a distance, too, for the 'eddy caused by the action of the
deeper immersed fins and tail of a rapidly moving gigantic seal
raising its head above the surface of the water,' as Professor Owen
imagines, in quest of its lost iceberg.</p>

<p>"The creative powers of the human mind may be very limited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
On this occasion they were not called into requisition; my purpose
and desire throughout being to furnish eminent naturalists, such
as the learned Professor, with accurate facts, and not with exaggerated
representations, nor with what could by any possibility proceed
from optical illusion; and I beg to assure him that old
Pontoppidan having clothed his sea-serpent with a mane could
not have suggested the idea of ornamenting the creature seen
from the 'D&aelig;dalus' with a similar appendage, for the simple
reason that I had never seen his account, or even heard of his
sea-serpent, until my arrival in London. Some other solution
must therefore be found for the very remarkable coincidence
between us in that particular, in order to unravel the mystery.</p>

<p>"Finally, I deny the existence of excitement or the possibility
of optical illusion. I adhere to the statements, as to form, colour,
and dimensions, contained in my official report to the Admiralty,
and I leave them as data whereupon the learned and scientific
may exercise the 'pleasures of imagination' until some more fortunate
opportunity shall occur of making a closer acquaintance
with the 'great unknown'&mdash;in the present instance most assuredly
no ghost.</p>

<p>Of course neither Professor Owen, nor any one else,
doubted the veracity or <i>bona fides</i> of the captain and
officers of one of Her Majesty's ships; and their testimony
was the more important because it was that of men accustomed
to the sights of the sea. Their practised eyes would,
probably, be able to detect the true character of anything
met with afloat, even if only partially seen, as intuitively as
the Red Indian reads the signs of the forest or the trail; and
therefore they were not likely to be deceived by any of the
objects with which sailors are familiar. They would not be
deluded by seals, porpoises, trunks of trees, or Brobdingnagian
stems of alg&aelig;; but there was one animal with which
they were not familiar, of the existence of which they were
unaware, and which, as I have said, at that date was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
generally believed to be as unreal as the sea-serpent itself&mdash;namely,
the great calamary, the elongated form of which
has certainly in some other instances been mistaken for
that of a sea-snake. One of these seen swimming in the
manner I have described, and endeavoured to portray
(p. 77), would fulfil the description given by Lieutenant
Drummond, and would in a great measure account for the
appearances reported by Captain M'Quh&aelig;. "<i>The head long,
pointed and flat on the top</i>," accords with the pointed extremity
and caudal fin of the squid. "<i>Head kept horizontal
with the surface of the water, and in rather a raised position,
disappearing occasionally beneath a wave for a very brief
interval, and not apparently for purposes of respiration.</i>"
A perfect description of the position and action of a squid
swimming. "<i>No portion of it perceptibly used in propelling
it through the water, either by vertical or horizontal undulations.</i>"
The mode of propulsion of a squid&mdash;the outpouring
stream of water from its locomotor tube&mdash;would be unseen
and unsuspected, because submerged. Its effect, the swirl
in its wake, would suggest a prolongation of the creature's
body. The numerous arms trailing astern at the surface
of the water would give the appearance of a mane. I
think it not impossible that if the officers of the <i>D&aelig;dalus</i>
had been acquainted with this great sea creature the impression
on their mind's eye would not have taken the
form of a serpent. I offer this, with much diffidence, as a
suggestion arising from recent discoveries; and by no means
insist on its acceptance; for Captain M'Quh&aelig;, who had a
very close view of the animal, distinctly says that "the
head was, without any doubt, that of a serpent," and one of
his officers subsequently declared that the eye, the mouth,
the nostril, the colour, and the form were all most distinctly
visible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>In a letter addressed to the Editor of the <i>Bombay Times</i>,
and dated "Kamptee, January 3rd, 1849," Mr. R. Davidson,
Superintending Surgeon, Nagpore Subsidiary Force, describes
a great sea animal seen by him whilst on board
the ship <i>Royal Saxon</i>, on a voyage to India, in 1829. The
features of this incident are consistent with his having seen
one of the, then unknown, great calamaries.</p>

<p>Dr. Scott, of Exeter, sent to the Editor of the <i>Zoologist</i>
(p. 2459), an extract from the memorandum-book of Lieutenant
Sandford, R.N., written about the year 1820, when
he was in command of the merchant ship <i>Lady Combermere</i>.
In it he mentions his having met with, in lat. 46, long. 3
(Bay of Biscay), an animal unknown to him, an immense
body on the surface of the water, spouting, not unlike the
blowing of a whale, and the raising up of a triangular extremity,
and subsequently of a head and neck erected six
feet above the surface of the water. This was evidently a
great squid seen under circumstances similar to those
described by Hans Egede (p. 67).</p>

<p>In the <i>Sun</i> Newspaper of July 9th, 1849, was published
the following statement of Captain Herriman, of the ship
<i>Brazilian</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"On the morning of the 24th February, the ship being becalmed
in lat. 26&deg; S., long. 8&deg; E. (about forty miles from the place
where Captain M'Quh&aelig; is said to have seen the serpent), the
captain perceived something right astern, stretched along the
water to a length of twenty five or thirty feet, and perceptibly
moving from the ship, with a steady sinuous motion. The head,
which seemed to be lifted several feet above the water, had something
resembling a mane running down to the floating portion,
and within about six feet of the tail. Of course Captain Herriman,
Mr. Long, his chief officer, and the passengers who saw this came
to the conclusion that it must be the sea-serpent. As the 'Brazilian'
was making no headway, to bring all doubts to an issue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the captain had a boat lowered, and himself standing in the
bow, armed with a harpoon, approached the monster. It was
found to be an immense piece of sea-weed, drifting with the
current, which sets constantly to the westward in this latitude,
and which, with the swell left by the subsidence of a previous
gale, gave it the sinuous snake-like motion."</p></blockquote>

<p>Captain Harrington, of the ship <i>Castilian</i>, reported in the
<i>Times</i> of February 5th, 1858, that:</p>

<blockquote><p>"On the 12th of December, 1857, N.E. end of St. Helena
distant ten miles, he and his officers were startled by the sight of
a huge marine animal which reared its head out of the water
within twenty yards of the ship. The head was shaped like a long
nun-buoy,<a name="Anchor_31_31" id="Anchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">&nbsp;[31]&nbsp;</a> and they supposed it to have been seven or eight feet
in diameter in the largest part, with a kind of scroll or tuft of loose
skin, encircling it about two feet from the top. The water was
discoloured for several hundred feet from its head, so much so
that on its first appearance my impression was that the ship was
in broken water."</p></blockquote>

<p>Evidently, again, a large calamary raising its caudal
extremity and fin above the surface, and discolouring the
water by discharging its ink.</p>

<p>This was immediately followed by a letter from Captain
Frederick Smith, of the ship <i>Pekin</i>, who stated that:</p>

<blockquote><p>"On December 28th, 1848, being then in lat. 26&deg; S., long. 6&deg; E.
(about half-way between the Cape and St. Helena), he saw a very
extraordinary-looking thing in the water, of considerable length.
With the telescope, he could plainly discern a huge head and neck,
covered with a shaggy-looking kind of mane, which it kept lifting
at intervals out of water. This was seen by all hands, and was
declared to be the great sea-serpent. A boat was lowered; a line
was made fast to the 'snake,' and it was towed alongside and
hoisted on board. It was a piece of gigantic sea-weed, twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
feet long, and completely covered with snaky-looking barnacles.
So like a huge living monster did this appear, that had circumstances
prevented my sending a boat to it, I should certainly have
believed I had seen the great sea-serpent."</p></blockquote>

<p>In September, 1872, Mr. Frank Buckland published, in
<i>Land and Water</i>, an account by the late Duke of Marlborough,
of a "sea-serpent" having been seen several times
within a few days, in Loch Hourn, Scotland. A sketch of
it was given which almost exactly accorded with that of
Pontoppidan's sea-serpent, namely, seven hunches or protuberances
like so many porpoises swimming in line, preceded
by a head and neck raised slightly out of water. Many other
accounts have been published of the appearance of serpent-like
sea monsters, but I have only space for two or three
more of the most remarkable of them.</p>

<p>On the 10th of January, 1877, the following affidavit was
made before Mr. Raffles, magistrate, at Liverpool:</p>

<blockquote><p>"We, the undersigned officers and crew of the barque 'Pauline'
(of London), of Liverpool, in the county of Lancaster, in the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, do solemnly and
sincerely declare that, on July 8, 1875, in lat. 5&deg; 13' S., long. 35&deg; W.,
we observed three large sperm whales, and one of them was gripped
round the body with two turns of what appeared to be a huge
serpent. The head and tail appeared to have a length beyond the
coils of about thirty feet, and its girth eight feet or nine feet. The
serpent whirled its victim round and round for about fifteen
minutes, and then suddenly dragged the whale to the bottom, head
first.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Geo. Drevar</span>, Master; <span class="smcap">Horatio Thompson</span>, <span class="smcap">John Henderson<br />
Landells</span>, <span class="smcap">Owen Baker</span>, and <span class="smcap">William<br />
Lewarn</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>"Again, on July 13, a similar serpent was seen, about two
hundred yards off, shooting itself along the surface, head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
neck being out of the water several feet. This was seen only
by the captain and one ordinary seaman.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">George Drevar</span>, Master.<br />
</p>

<p>"A few moments after it was seen some 60 feet elevated perpendicularly
in the air by the chief officer and the following
seamen:&mdash;Horatio Thompson, Owen Baker, Wm. Lewarn. And
we make this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the
same to be true."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, of November 20th, 1875,
there had previously appeared a letter from the Rev. E. L.
Penny, Chaplain to H.M.S. <i>London</i>, at Zanzibar, describing
this occurrence and also the representation of a sketch
(which I am kindly permitted to reproduce here), drawn by
him from the descriptions given by the captain and crew
of the <i>Pauline</i>. "The whale," he said, "should have been
placed deeper in the water, but he would then have been
unable to depict so clearly the manner in which the animal
was attacked." He adds that, "Captain Drevar is a singularly
able and observant man, and those of the crew and officers
with whom he conversed were singularly intelligent; nor did
any of their descriptions vary from one another in the least:
there were no discrepancies." The event took place whilst
their vessel was on her way from Shields to Zanzibar, with
a cargo of coals, for the use of H.M.S. <i>London</i>, then the
guard ship on that station.</p>

<p>It is impossible to doubt for a moment the genuineness
of the statement made by Captain Drevar and his crew, or
their honest desire to describe faithfully that which they
believed they had seen; but the height to which the snake is
said to have upreared itself is evidently greatly exaggerated;
for it is impossible that any serpent could "elevate its body
some sixty feet perpendicularly in the air"&mdash;nearly one-third
of the height of the Monument of the Great Fire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>London. I have no desire to force this narrative of the
master and crew of the <i>Pauline</i> into conformity with any
preconceived idea. They may have seen a veritable sea-serpent;
or they may have witnessed the amours of two
whales, and have seen the great creatures rolling over and
over that they might breathe alternately by the blow-hole
of each coming to the surface of the water; or the supposed
coils of the snake may have been the arms of a great
calamary, cast over and around the huge cetacean. The
other two appearances&mdash;1st, the animal "seen shooting
itself along the surface with head and neck raised" (p. 77),
and 2nd, the elevation of the body to a considerable height,
as in Egede's sea monster, (p. 67), would certainly accord
with this last hypothesis; but, taking the statement as it
stands, it must be left for further elucidation.</p>

<p>On the 28th of January, 1879, a "sea-serpent" was seen
from the s.s. <i>City of Baltimore</i>, in the Gulf of Aden, by
Major H. W. J. Senior, of the Bengal Staff Corps. The
narrator "observed a long, black object darting rapidly in
and out of the water, and advancing nearer to the vessel.
The shape of the head was not unlike pictures of the
dragon he had often seen, with a bull-dog expression of the
forehead and eyebrows. When the monster had drawn its
head sufficiently out of the water, it let its body drop, as it
were a log of wood, prior to darting forward under the
water. This motion caused a splash of about fifteen feet
in length on either side of the neck much in the 'shape
of a pair of wings.'" This last particular of its appearance,
as well as its movements, suggest a great calamary; but,
as one with "a bull-dog expression of eyebrow, visible at
500 yards distance," does not come within my ken, I will
not claim it as such.</p>

<p>In June 1877 Commander Pearson reported to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Admiralty, that on the 2nd of that month, he and other
officers of the Royal Yacht <i>Osborne</i>, had seen, off Cape
Vito, Sicily, a large marine animal, of which the following
account and sketches were furnished by Lieutenant Haynes,
and were confirmed by Commander Pearson, Mr. Douglas
Haynes, Mr. Forsyth, and Mr. Moore, engineer.</p>

</div>

<blockquote><p>"Lieutenant Haynes writes, under date, 'Royal Yacht <i>Osborne</i>,
Gibraltar, June 6': On the evening of that day, the sea being perfectly
smooth, my attention was first called by seeing a ridge of fins above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the surface of the water, extending about thirty feet, and varying
from five to six feet in height. On inspecting it by means of a
telescope, at about one and a-half cables' distance, I distinctly saw
a head, two flappers, and about thirty feet of an animal's shoulder.
The head, as nearly as I could judge, was about six feet thick, the
neck narrower, about four to five feet, the shoulder about fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
feet across, and the flappers each about fifteen feet in length. The
movements of the flappers were those of a turtle, and the animal
resembled a huge seal, the resemblance being strongest about the
back of the head. I could not see the length of the head, but
from its crown or top to just below the shoulder (where it became
immersed), I should reckon about fifty feet. The tail end I did
not see, being under water, unless the ridge of fins to which my
attention was first attracted, and which had disappeared by the
time I got a telescope, were really the continuation of the shoulder
to the end of the object's body. The animal's head was not always
above water, but was thrown upwards, remaining above for a few
seconds at a time, and then disappearing. There was an entire
absence of 'blowing,' or 'spouting.' I herewith beg to enclose
a rough sketch, showing the view of the 'ridge of fins,' and also
of the animal in the act of propelling itself by its two fins."</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that this description cannot be explained
as applicable to any one animal yet known. The ridge of
dorsal fins might, possibly, as was suggested by Mr. Frank
Buckland, belong to four basking sharks, swimming in
line, in close order; but the combination of them with long
flippers, and the turtle-like mode of swimming, forms a
zoological enigma which I am unable to solve.</p>

<p>This brings us face to face with the question: "Is it then
so impossible that there may exist some great sea creature,
or creatures, with which zoologists are hitherto unacquainted,
that it is necessary in every case to regard the authors of
such narratives as wilfully untruthful, or mistaken in their
observations, if their descriptions are irreconcileable with
something already known?" I, for one, am of the opinion
that there is no such impossibility. Calamaries or squids
of the ordinary size have, from time immemorial, been
amongst the commonest and best known of marine
animals in many seas; but only a few years ago any one
who expressed his belief in one formidable enough to capsize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
a boat, or pull a man out of one, was derided for his
credulity, although voyagers had constantly reported that
in the Indian seas they were so dreaded that the natives
always carried hatchets with them in their canoes, with
which to cut off the arms or tentacles of these creatures, if
attacked by them. We now know that their existence is
no fiction; for individuals have been captured measuring
more than fifty feet, and some are reported to have
measured eighty feet, in total length. As marine snakes
some feet in length, and having fin-like tails adapted for
swimming, abound over an extensive geographical range,
and are frequently met with far at sea, I cannot regard it
as impossible that some of these also may attain to an
abnormal and colossal development. Dr. Andrew Wilson,
who has given much attention to this subject, is of the
opinion that "in this huge development of ordinary forms
we discover the true and natural law of the production of
the giant serpent of the sea." It goes far, at any rate,
towards accounting for its supposed appearance. I am
convinced that, whilst naturalists have been searching amongst
the vertebrata for a solution of the problem, the great unknown,
and therefore unrecognized, calamaries by their elongated,
cylindrical bodies and peculiar mode of swimming, have
played the part of the sea-serpent in many a well-authenticated
incident. In other cases, such as some of those mentioned
by Pontoppidan, the supposed "vertical undulations"
of the snake seen out of water have been the burly bodies
of so many porpoises swimming in line&mdash;the connecting
undulations beneath the surface have been supplied by the
imagination. The dorsal fins of basking sharks, as figured
by Mr. Buckland, or of ribbon-fishes, as suggested by Dr.
Andrew Wilson, may have furnished the "ridge of fins;"
an enormous conger is not an impossibility; a giant turtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
may have done duty, with its propelling flippers and broad
back; or a marine snake of enormous size may, really, have
been seen. But if we accept as accurate the observations
recorded (which I certainly do not in all cases, for they are
full of errors and mistakes), the difficulty is not entirely met,
even by this last admission, for the instances are very few
in which an ophidian proper&mdash;a true serpent&mdash;is indicated.
There has seemed to be wanting an animal having a long
snake-like neck, a small head and a slender body, and propelling
itself by paddles.<a name="Anchor_32_32" id="Anchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">&nbsp;[32]&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>The similarity of such an animal to the <i>Plesiosaurus</i> of
old was remarkable. That curious compound reptile, which
has been compared with "a snake threaded through the
body of a turtle," is described by Dean Buckland, in his
<i>Bridgewater Treatise</i>, as having "the head of a lizard, the
teeth of a crocodile, a neck of enormous length resembling
the body of a serpent, the ribs of a chameleon, and the
paddles of a whale." In the number of its cervical vertebr&aelig;
(about thirty-three) it surpasses that of the longest-necked
bird, the swan.</p>

<p>The form and probable movements of this ancient saurian
agree so markedly with some of the accounts given of the
"great sea-serpent," that Mr. Edward Newman advanced
the opinion that the closest affinities of the latter would be
found to be with the <i>Enaliosauria</i>, or marine lizards, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>fossil remains are so abundant in the oolite and the lias.
This view has also been taken by other writers, and emphatically
by Mr. Gosse. Neither he nor
Mr. Newman insist that the "great
unknown" must be the <i>Plesiosaurus</i>
itself. Mr. Gosse says, "I should not
look for any species, scarcely even
any genus, to be perpetuated from
the oolitic period to the present. Admitting
the actual continuation of
the order <i>Enaliosauria</i>, it would be, I
think, quite in conformity with general
analogy to find some salient features
of several extinct forms."</p>

<p>The form and habits of the recently-recognized
gigantic cuttles account for
so many appearances which, without
knowledge of them, were inexplicable
when Mr. Gosse and Mr. Newman
wrote, that I think this theory is not
now forced upon us. Mr. Gosse well
and clearly sums up the evidence as
follows: "Carefully comparing the
independent narratives of English
witnesses of known character and
position, most of them being officers
under the crown, we have a creature
possessing the following characteristics:
1st. The general form of a
serpent. 2nd. Great length, say above
sixty feet. 3rd. Head considered to
resemble that of a serpent. 4th. Neck from twelve to
sixteen inches in diameter. 5th. Appendages on the head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
neck, or back, resembling a crest or mane. (Considerable
discrepancy in details.) 6th. Colour dark brown, or green,
streaked or spotted with white. 7th. Swims at surface of
the water with a rapid or slow movement, the head and
neck projected and elevated above the surface. 8th.
Progression, steady and uniform; the body straight, but
capable of being thrown into convolutions. 9th. Spouts
in the manner of a whale. 10th. Like a long nun-buoy."
He concludes with the question&mdash;"To which of the recognized
classes of created beings can this huge rover of
the ocean be referred?"</p>

<p>I reply: "To the Cephalopoda. There is not one of
the above judiciously summarized characteristics that is
not supplied by the great calamary, and its ascertained
habits and peculiar mode of locomotion.</p>

<p>"Only a geologist can fully appreciate how enormously the
balance of probability is contrary to the supposition that
any of the gigantic marine saurians of the secondary
deposits should have continued to live up to the present time.
And yet I am bound to say, that this does not amount
to an impossibility, for the evidence against it is entirely
negative. Nor is the conjecture that there may be in
existence some congeners of these great reptiles inconsistent
with zoological science. Dr. J. E. Gray, late of the British
Museum, a strict zoologist, is cited by Mr. Gosse as having
long ago expressed his opinion that some undescribed form
exists which is intermediate between the tortoises and the
serpents."<a name="Anchor_33_33" id="Anchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">&nbsp;[33]&nbsp;</a></p>

After Mr. P. H. Gosse, F.R.S.</span>

<p>Professor Agassiz, too, is adduced by a correspondent of
the <i>Zoologist</i> (p. 2395), as having said concerning the present
existence of the <i>Enaliosaurian</i> type that "it would be in
precise conformity with analogy that such an animal should
exist in the American Seas, as he had found numerous
instances in which the fossil forms of the Old World were
represented by living types in the New."</p>

<p>On this point, Mr. Newman records, in the <i>Zoologist</i>
(p. 2356), an actual testimony which he considers, "in all
respects, the most interesting natural-history fact of the
present century." He writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Captain the Hon. George Hope states that when in H.M.S.
'Fly,' in the Gulf of California, the sea being perfectly calm and
transparent, he saw at the bottom a large marine animal with the
head and general figure of the alligator, except that the neck was
much longer, and that instead of legs the creature had four large
flappers, somewhat like those of turtles, the anterior pair being
larger than the posterior; the creature was distinctly visible, and
all its movements could be observed with ease; it appeared to
be pursuing its prey at the bottom of the sea; its movements
were somewhat serpentine, and an appearance of annulations, or
ring-like divisions of the body, was distinctly perceptible. Captain
Hope made this relation in company, and as a matter of conversation.
When I heard it from the gentleman to whom it was narrated,
I enquired whether Captain Hope was acquainted with
those remarkable fossil animals <i>Ichthyosauri</i> and <i>Plesiosauri</i>, the
supposed forms of which so nearly correspond with what he describes
as having seen alive, and I cannot find that he had heard
of them; the alligator being the only animal he mentioned as
bearing a partial similarity to the creature in question."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the estimated dimensions of this creature
are not given.</p>

<p>That negative evidence alone is an unsafe basis for argument
against the existence of unknown animals, the following
illustrations will show:</p>

<p>During the deep-sea dredgings of H.M.S. <i>Lightning</i>,
<i>Porcupine</i>, and <i>Challenger</i>, many new species of mollusca,
and others which had been supposed to have been extinct
ever since the chalk epoch, were brought to light; and by
the deep-sea trawlings of the last-mentioned ship, there have
been brought up from great depths fishes of unknown
species, and which could not exist near the surface, owing
to the distension and rupture of their air-bladder when
removed from the pressure of deep water.</p>

<p>Mr. Gosse mentions that the ship in which he made the
voyage to Jamaica was surrounded in the North Atlantic,
for seventeen continuous hours by a troop of whales of
large size of an undescribed species, which on no other
occasion has fallen under scientific observation. Unique
specimens of other cetaceans are also recorded.</p>

<p>We have evidence, to which attention has been directed
by Mr. A. D. Bartlett, that, "even on land there exists at
least one of the largest mammals, probably in thousands,
of which only one individual has been brought to notice,
namely, the hairy-eared, two horned rhinoceros (<i>R. lasiotis</i>),
now in the Zoological Gardens, London. It was captured
in 1868, at Chittagong, in India, where for years collectors
and naturalists have worked and published lists of the
animals met with, and yet no knowledge of this great beast
was ever before obtained, nor is there any portion of one in
any museum. It remains unique."</p>

<p>I arrive, then, at the following conclusions: 1st. That,
without straining resemblances, or casting a doubt upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
narratives not proved to be erroneous, the various appearances
of the supposed "Great Sea-serpent" may now be
nearly all accounted for by the forms and habits of known
animals; especially if we admit, as proposed by Dr. Andrew
Wilson, that some of them, including the marine snakes,
may, like the cuttles, attain to an extraordinary size.</p>

<p>2nd. That to assume that naturalists have perfect cognizance
of every existing marine animal of large size, would
be quite unwarrantable. It appears to me more than probable
that many marine animals, unknown to science, and
some of them of gigantic size, may have their ordinary
habitat in the great depths of the sea, and only occasionally
come to the surface; and I think it not impossible that
amongst them may be marine snakes of greater dimensions
than we are aware of, and even a creature having close
affinities with the old sea-reptiles whose fossil skeletons tell
of their magnitude and abundance in past ages.</p>

<p>It is most desirable that every supposed appearance of
the "Great Sea-serpent" shall be faithfully noted and
described; and I hope that no truthful observer will be
deterred from reporting such an occurrence by fear of the
disbelief of naturalists, or the ridicule of witlings.</p>

<p>PREFACE.</p>


<p>The little book 'Sea Monsters Unmasked,' recently
issued as one of the Handbooks in connection with the
Great International Fisheries Exhibition has met with so
favourable a reception, that I have been honoured by the
request to continue the subject, and to treat also of some
of the Fables of the Sea, which once were universally
believed, and even now are not utterly extinct.</p>

<p>The topic is not here exhausted. Other sea fables and
fallacies might be mentioned and explained; but the
amount of letter-press, and the number of illustrations that
can be printed without loss for the small sum of one
shilling&mdash;the price at which these Handbooks are uniformly
published&mdash;is necessarily limited. I have, therefore, thought
it better to endeavour to make each chapter as complete
as possible than to crowd into the space allotted to me a
greater variety of subjects less fully and carefully discussed.</p>

<p>I have the pleasure of acknowledging the kind assistance
I have again received in the matter of illustrations.
I gratefully appreciate Mr. Murray's permission to use
the woodcut of Hercules slaying the Hydra, taken from
Smith's 'Classical Dictionary,' and those of the golden
ornaments found by Dr. Schliemann at Mycen&aelig;, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi_b" id="Page_vi_b">[Pg vi]</a></span>
figured in the very interesting book in which his excavations
there are described. I have also to thank the
proprietors of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, the <i>Leisure
Hour</i>, and <i>Land and Water</i>, for the use of illustrations
especially mentioned in the text.</p>

<p>Next to the pleasure which the earnest zoologist derives
from study of the habits and structure of living animals,
and his intelligent appreciation of their perfect adaptation
to their modes of life, and the circumstances in which they
are placed, is the interest he feels in eliminating fiction
from truth, whilst comparing the fancies of the past with the
facts of the present. As his knowledge increases, he learns
that the descriptions by ancient writers of so-called "fabulous
creatures" are rather distorted portraits than invented
falsehoods, and that there is hardly one of the monsters of old
which has not its prototype in Nature at the present day.
The idea of the Lernean Hydra, whose heads grew again
when cut off by Hercules, originated, as I have shown in
another chapter, in a knowledge of the octopus; and in
the form and movements of other animals with which we
are now familiar we may, in like manner, recognise the
similitude and archetype of the mermaid.</p>

<p>But we must search deeply into the history of mankind
to discover the real source of a belief that has prevailed in
almost all ages, and in all parts of the world, in the
existence of a race of beings uniting the form of man with
that of the fish. A rude resemblance between these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_b" id="Page_2_b">[Pg 2]</a></span>
creatures of imagination and tradition and certain aquatic
animals is not sufficient to account for that belief. It
probably had its origin in ancient mythologies, and in the
sculptures and pictures connected with them, which were
designed to represent certain attributes of the deities of
various nations. In the course of time the meaning of
these was lost; and subsequent generations regarded as
the portraits of existing beings effigies which were at first
intended to be merely emblematic and symbolical.</p>

</div>

<p>Early idolatry consisted, first, in separating the idea of
the One Divinity into that of his various attributes, and of
inventing symbols and making images of each separately;
secondly, in the worship of the sun, moon, stars, and
planets, as living existences; thirdly, in the deification of
ancestors and early kings; and these three forms were
often mingled together in strange and tangled confusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_b" id="Page_3_b">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst the famous personages with whose history men
were made acquainted by oral tradition was Noah. He
was known as the second father of the human race, and
the preserver and teacher of the arts and sciences as they
existed before the Great Deluge, of which so many separate
traditions exist among the various races of mankind. Consequently,
he was an object of worship in many countries
and under many names; and his wife and sons, as his
assistants in the diffusion of knowledge, were sometimes
associated with him.</p>

<p>According to Berosus, of Babylon,&mdash;the Chaldean priest
and astronomer, who extracted from the sacred books of
"that great city" much interesting ancient lore, which he introduced
into his 'History of Syria,' written, about <small>B.C.</small> 260,
for the use of the Greeks,&mdash;at a time when men were sunk
in barbarism, there came up from the Erythrean Sea (the
Persian Gulf), and landed on the Babylonian shore, a creature
named Oannes, which had the body and head of a fish. But
above the fish's head was the head of a man, and below the
tail of the fish were human feet. It had also human arms, a
human voice, and human language. This strange monster
sojourned among the rude people during
the day, taking no food, but retiring to
the sea at night; and it continued for
some time thus to visit them, teaching
them the arts of civilized life, and instructing
them in science and religion.<a name="Anchor_34_34" id="Anchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">&nbsp;[34]&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>In this tale we have a distorted account
of the life and occupation of Noah
after his escape from the deluge which
destroyed his home and drowned his
neighbours. Oannes was one of the names under which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_b" id="Page_4_b">[Pg 4]</a></span>he was worshipped in Chaldea, at Erech ("the place of the
ark"), as the sacred and intelligent fish-god, the teacher
of mankind, the god of science and knowledge. There he
was also called Oes, Hoa, Ea, Ana, Anu, Aun, and Oan.
Noah was worshipped, also, in Syria and Mesopotamia,
and in Egypt, at "populous
No,"<a name="Anchor_35_35" id="Anchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">&nbsp;[35]&nbsp;</a> or Thebes&mdash;so named
from "Theba," "the ark."</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 3.&mdash;DAGON. From a bas

</div>

<p>The history of the coffin of
Osiris is another version of
Noah's ark, and the period
during which that Egyptian
divinity is said to have been
shut up in it, after it was set
afloat upon the waters, was
precisely the same as that
during which Noah remained
in the ark.</p>

<p>Dagon, also&mdash;sometimes
called Odacon&mdash;the great fish-god
of the Philistines and
Babylonians, was another
phase of Oannes. "Dag," in
Hebrew, signifies "a male
fish," and "Aun" and "Oan"
were two of the names of
Noah. "Dag-aun" or "Dag-oan"
therefore means "the fish Noah." He was portrayed
in two ways. The more ancient image of him was that
of a man issuing from a fish, as described of Oannes by
Berosus; but in later times it was varied to that of a man
whose upper half was human, and the lower parts those of
a fish. The image of Dagon which fell upon its face to
the ground before "the ark of the God of Israel," was
probably of this latter form, for we read<a name="Anchor_36_36" id="Anchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">&nbsp;[36]&nbsp;</a> that in its fall,
"the head of Dagon and
both the palms of his hands
were cut off upon the threshold:
only the <i>stump</i> (in the
margin, "<i>the fishy part</i>") of
Dagon was left to him. This
was evidently Milton's conception
of him:</p>

"Dagon his name; sea-monster, upward man<br />
And downward fish."<a name="Anchor_37_37" id="Anchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">&nbsp;[37]&nbsp;</a><br />

<span class="caption">FIG. 6.&mdash;FISH AVATAR OF VISHNU.

After Calmet and Maurice.</span>
</div>

<p>In one of his "avatars,"
or incarnations,
the god Vishnu "the
Preserver," is represented
as issuing from
the mouth of a fish.
He is celebrated as
having miraculously
preserved one righteous
family, and, also, the
Vedas, the sacred records,
when the world
was drowned. Not only
is this legend of the
Indian god wrought up
with the history of
Noah, but Vishnu and
Noah bear the same
name&mdash;Vishnu being
the Sanscrit form of
"Ish-nuh," "the man
Noah." The word
"avatar" also means
"out of the boat." In
fact the whole mythology
of Greece and
Rome, as well as of
Asia, is full of the history
and deeds of Noah,
which it is impossible
to misunderstand. In all the representations of a deity
having a combined human and piscine form, the original idea
was that of a person coming out of a fish&mdash;not being part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7_b" id="Page_7_b">[Pg 7]</a></span>
one, but issuing from it, as Noah issued from the ark. In
all of them the fish denoted "preservation," "fecundity,"
"plenty," and "diffusion of knowledge."<a name="Anchor_38_38" id="Anchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">&nbsp;[38]&nbsp;</a> As the image
was not the effigy of a divine personage, but symbolized
certain attributes of Divinity, its sex was comparatively
unimportant, although it is possible that, combined with
the fecundity of the fish, the idea of Noah's wife, as the
second mother of all subsequent generations, according to
the widely-spread and accepted traditions of the deluge,
may have influenced the impersonation.</p>

<p>Atergatis, the far-famed goddess of the Syrians, was also
a fish-divinity. Her image, like that of Dagon, had at
first a fish's body with human extremities protruding
from it; but in the course of centuries it was gradually
altered to that of a being the upper portion of whose
body was that of a woman and the lower half that of
a fish. Gatis was a powerful queen of Sidon, and mother
of Semiramis. She received the title of "Ater," or "Ader,"
"the Great," for the benefits she conferred on her people;
one of these benefits being a strict conservation of their
fisheries, both from their own imprudent use, and from foreign
interference. She issued an edict that no fish should be
eaten without her consent, and that no one should take fish
in the neighbouring sea without a licence from herself. It
is not improbable that she and her celebrated daughter, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8_b" id="Page_8_b">[Pg 8]</a></span>is said by Ovid and others to have been the builder of the
walls of Babylon, were worshipped together; for that
Atergatis was the same as the fish-goddess Ashteroth, or
Ashtoreth, "the builder of the encompassing wall," we have,
amongst other proofs, a remarkable one in Biblical history.
In the first book of Maccabees v. 43, 44, we read that "all
the heathen being discomfited before him (Judas Maccabeus)
cast away their weapons, and fled unto the temple that was
at <i>Carnaim</i>. But they took the city, and burned the temple
with all that were therein. Thus was <i>Carnaim</i> subdued,
neither could they stand any longer before Judas." In the
second book of Maccabees xii. 26, we are told that "Maccabeus
marched forth to <i>Carnion</i>, and to the temple of <i>Atargatis</i>,
and there he slew five and twenty thousand persons."
In Genesis xiv. 5, this city and temple are referred to as
"<i>Ashteroth Karnaim</i>."</p>

<p>Fig. 7 is a representation of Atergatis
on a medal coined at Marseilles.
It shows that when the Ph&oelig;nician
colony from Syria, by whom that city
was founded, settled there, they
brought with them the worship of
the gods of their country.</p>

<p>Atergatis was worshipped by the
Greeks as Derceto and Astarte.
Lucian writes<a name="Anchor_39_39" id="Anchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">&nbsp;[39]&nbsp;</a>:&mdash;"In Ph&oelig;nicia I saw the image of Derceto,
a strange sight, truly! For she had the half of
a woman, and from the thighs downwards a fish's tail."
Diodorus Siculus describes (lib. ii.) the same deity, as
represented at Ascalon, as "having the face of a woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9_b" id="Page_9_b">[Pg 9]</a></span>but all the rest of the body a fish's." And this very same
image at Ascalon, which Diodorus calls Derceto, or
Atergatis, is denominated by Herodotus<a name="Anchor_40_40" id="Anchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">&nbsp;[40]&nbsp;</a> "the celestial
Aphrodite," who was identical with the Cyprian and Roman
Venus. Of all the sacred buildings erected to the goddess,
this temple was by far the most ancient; and the Cyprians
themselves acknowledged that their temple was built after
the model of it by certain Ph&oelig;nicians who came from
that part of Syria.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus the worship of Noah, as the second father of mankind,
the repopulator of the earth, passed through various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10_b" id="Page_10_b">[Pg 10]</a></span>phases and transformations till it merged in that of Venus,
who rose from the sea, and was regarded as the representative
of the reproductive power of Nature&mdash;the goddess whom
Lucretius thus addressed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Blest Venus! Thou the sea and fruitful earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Peoplest amain; to thee whatever lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Its being owes, and that it sees the sun:"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and to whom refers the passage in the Orphic hymn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From thee are all things&mdash;all things thou producest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Which are in heaven, or in the fertile earth,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Under this latter phase&mdash;the impersonation of Venus&mdash;the
fish portion of the body was discarded, and the cast-off
form was allotted in popular credence to the Tritons&mdash;minor
deities, who acknowledged the supremacy of the goddess,
and were ready to render her homage and service by bearing
her in their arms, drawing her chariot, etc., but who still
possessed considerable power as sea-gods, and could calm
the waves and rule the storm, at pleasure.</p>

<p>Figs. 9 and 10 are from two Corinthian medals, each
shewing Venus in a car or chariot drawn by Tritons, one
male, the other female. On the obverse of Fig. 9, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11_b" id="Page_11_b">[Pg 11]</a></span>
head of Nero, and on that of Fig. 10, the head of his

<p>From the very earliest period of history, then, the
conjoined human and fish form was known to every
generation of men. It was presented to their sight in
childhood by sculptures and pictures, and was a conspicuous
object in their religious worship. By the lapse of time its
original import was lost and debased; and, from being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12_b" id="Page_12_b">[Pg 12]</a></span>an emblem and symbol, it came to be accepted as the
corporeal shape and structure of actually-existent sea-deities,
who might present themselves to the view of the
mariner, in visible and tangible form, at any moment.
Thus were men trained and prepared to believe in mermen
and mermaids, to expect to meet with them at sea, and to
recognise as one of them any animal the appearance and
movements of which could possibly be brought into conformity
with their pre-conceived ideas.</p>

<p>Accordingly, and very naturally, we find that from north
to south this belief has been entertained. Megasthenes,
who was a contemporary of Aristotle, but his junior, and
whose geographical work was probably written at about the
period of the great philosopher's death, reported that the sea
which surrounded Taprobana, the ancient Ceylon, was inhabited
by creatures having the appearance of women.
&AElig;lian stated that there were "whales," or "great fishes,"
having the form of satyrs. The early Portuguese settlers in
India asserted that true mermen were found in the Eastern
seas, and old Norse legends tell of submarine beings of conjoined
human and piscine form, who dwell in a wide territory
far below the region of the fishes, over which the sea, like
the cloudy canopy of our sky, loftily rolls, and some of whom
have, from time to time, landed on Scandinavian shores,
exchanged their fishy extremities for human limbs, and
acquired amphibious habits. Not only have poets sung of
the wondrous and seductive beauty of the maidens of these
aquatic tribes, but many a Jack tar has come home from
sea prepared to affirm on oath that he has seen a mermaid.
To the best of his belief he has told the truth. He has
seen some living being which looked wonderfully human,
and his imagination, aided by an inherited superstition, has
supplied the rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13_b" id="Page_13_b">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Before endeavouring to identify the object of his delusion,
it may be well to mention a few instances of the supposed
appearance of mermen and mermaidens in various localities.</p>

<p>Pliny writes<a name="Anchor_42_42" id="Anchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">&nbsp;[42]&nbsp;</a>: "When Tiberius was emperor, an embassy
was sent to him from Olysippo (Lisbon) expressly to
inform him that a Triton, which was recognised as such by
its form, had shown itself in a certain cave, and had been
heard to produce loud sounds on a conch-shell. The
Nereid, also, is not imaginary: its body is rough and
covered with scales, but it has the appearance of a human
being. For one was seen upon the same coast; and when
it was dying those dwelling near at hand heard it moaning
sadly for a long time. And the Governor of Gaul wrote to
the divine Augustus that several Nereids had been found
dead upon the shore. I have many informants&mdash;illustrious
persons in high positions&mdash;who have assured me that they
saw in the Sea of Cadiz a merman whose whole body was
exactly like that of a man, that these mermen mount on
board ships by night, and weigh down that end of the
vessel on which they rest, and that if they are allowed to
remain there long they will sink the ship."</p>

<p>&AElig;lian in one of his short, jerky, disconnected chapters,<a name="Anchor_43_43" id="Anchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">&nbsp;[43]&nbsp;</a>
which rarely exceed a page in length, and some of which
only contain two lines, writes: "It is reported that the
great sea which surrounds the island of Taprobana (Ceylon)
contains an immense multitude of fishes and whales, and
some of them have the heads of lions, panthers, rams, and
other animals; and (which is more wonderful still) some of
the cetaceans have the form of satyrs. There are others
which have the face of a woman, but prickles instead of
hair. In addition to these, it is said there are other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14_b" id="Page_14_b">[Pg 14]</a></span>creatures of so strange and monstrous a kind that it would
be impossible exactly to explain their appearance without
the aid of a skilfully drawn picture: these have elongated
and coiled tails, and, for feet, have claws<a name="Anchor_44_44" id="Anchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">&nbsp;[44]&nbsp;</a> or fins. And I
hear that in the same sea there are great amphibious
beasts which are gregarious, and live on grain, and by night
feed on the corn crops and grass, and are also very fond of
the ripe fruit of the palms. To obtain these they encircle
in their embrace the trees which are young and flexible,
and, shaking them violently, enjoy the fruit which they thus
cause to fall. When morning dawns they return to the
sea, and plunge beneath the waves."</p>

<p>&AElig;lian seems to have derived this information from
Megasthenes, already referred to; but in another chapter,<a name="Anchor_45_45" id="Anchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">&nbsp;[45]&nbsp;</a>
he writes with greater certainty concerning these semi-human
whales, and claims divine authority for his belief in the existence
of tritons. "Although," he says, "we have no rational
explanation nor absolute proof of that which fishermen are
said to be able to affirm concerning the form of the tritons,
we have the sworn testimony of many persons that there are
in the sea cetaceans which from the head down to the middle
of the body resemble the human species. Demostratus,
in his works on fishing, says that an aged triton was seen
near the town of Tanagra, in B&oelig;otia, which was like the
drawings and pictures of tritons, but its features were so
obscured by age, and it disappeared so quickly, that its true
character was not easily perceptible. But on the spot
where it had rested on the shore were found some rough
and very hard scales which had become detached from it.
A certain senator&mdash;one of those selected by lot to carry on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15_b" id="Page_15_b">[Pg 15]</a></span>the administration of Achaia and the duties of the annual
magistracy" (the mayor, in fact,) "being anxious to investigate
the nature of this triton, put a portion of its skin
on the fire. It gave out a most horrible odour; and those
standing by were unable to decide whether it belonged
to a terrestrial or marine animal. But the magistrate's
curiosity had an evil ending, for very soon afterwards,
whilst crossing a narrow creek in a boat, he fell overboard
and was drowned; and the Tanagreans all regarded this as
a judgment upon him for his crime of impiety towards the
triton&mdash;an interpretation which was confirmed when his
decomposing body was cast ashore, for it emitted exactly
the same odour as had the burned skin of the triton. The
Tanagreans and Demostratus explain whence the triton
had strayed, and how it was stranded in this place. I
believe," continues &AElig;lian, "that tritons exist, and I reverentially
produce as my witness a most veracious god&mdash;namely,
Apollo Didym&aelig;us, whom no man in his senses would
presume to regard as unworthy of credit. He sings thus
of the triton, which he calls the sheep of the sea:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Dum vocale maris monstrum natat &aelig;quore triton,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Neptuni pecus, in funes forte incidit extra</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Demissos navim</i>';"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which I venture to translate as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A triton, vocal monster of the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of a flock of Neptune's scaly sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was caught, whilst swimming o'er the watery plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By lines which fishers from their boat had lain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Therefore," &AElig;lian concludes, "if he, the omniscient god,
pronounces that there are tritons, it does not behove us to
doubt their existence."</p>

<p>Sir J. Emerson Tennent, in his 'Natural History of
Ceylon,' quoting from the <i>Histoire de la Compagnie de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16_b" id="Page_16_b">[Pg 16]</a></span>
J&eacute;sus</i>, mentions that the annalist of the exploits of the
Jesuits in India gravely records that seven of these
monsters, male and female, were captured at Manaar, in
1560, and carried to Goa, where they were dissected by
Demas Bosquez, physician to the Viceroy, "and their
internal structure found to be in all respects conformable to
the human." He also quotes Valentyn, one of the Dutch
colonial chaplains, who, in his account of the Natural History
of Amboyna,<a name="Anchor_46_46" id="Anchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">&nbsp;[46]&nbsp;</a> embodied in his great work on the Netherlands'
possessions in India, published in 1727,<a name="Anchor_47_47" id="Anchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">&nbsp;[47]&nbsp;</a> devoted
the first section of his chapter on the fishes of that island
to a minute description of the "Zee-Menschen," "Zee-Wyven,"
and mermaids, the existence of which he warmly
insists on as being beyond cavil. He relates that in 1663,
when a lieutenant in the Dutch service was leading a party
of soldiers along the sea-shore in Amboyna, he and all his
company saw the mermen swimming at a short distance
from the beach. They had long and flowing hair of a
colour between grey and green. Six weeks afterwards the
creatures were again seen by him and more than fifty
witnesses, at the same place, by clear daylight. "If any
narrative in the world," adds Valentyn, "deserves credit it
is this; since not only one, but two mermen together were
seen by so many eye-witnesses. Should the stubborn
world, however, hesitate to believe it, it matters nothing,
as there are people who would even deny that such cities
as Rome, Constantinople, or Cairo, exist, merely because
they themselves have not happened to see them. But
what are such incredulous persons," he continues, "to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17_b" id="Page_17_b">[Pg 17]</a></span>of the circumstance recorded by Albrecht Herport<a name="Anchor_48_48" id="Anchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">&nbsp;[48]&nbsp;</a> in his
account of India, that a merman was seen in the water
near the church of Taquan on the morning of the 29th of
April, 1661, and a mermaid at the same spot the same
afternoon? Or what do they say to the fact that in 1714
a mermaid was not only seen but captured near the island
of Booro, five feet, Rhineland measure, in height; which
lived four days and seven hours, but, refusing all food,
died without leaving any intelligible account of herself?"
Valentyn, in support of his own faith in the mermaid, cites
many other instances in which both "sea-men and sea-women"
were seen and taken at Amboyna; especially one
by a district visitor of the church, who presented it to the
Governor Vanderstel. Of this "well-authenticated" specimen
he gives an elaborate portrait amongst the fishes of the island,<a name="Anchor_49_49" id="Anchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">&nbsp;[49]&nbsp;</a>

men of science.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 12.&mdash;MERMAID AND FISHES OF AMBOYNA. After Valentyn.</span>
</div>

<p>The fame of this creature having reached Europe, the
British minister in Holland wrote to Valentyn on the 28th
of December, 1716, whilst the Emperor Peter the Great, of
Russia, was his guest at Amsterdam, to communicate the
desire of the Czar that the mermaid should be brought
home from Amboyna for his inspection. To complete his
proofs of the existence of mermen and merwomen, Valentyn
points triumphantly to the historical fact that in Holland,
in the year 1404, a mermaid was driven, during a tempest,
through a breach in the dyke of Edam, and was taken alive
in the lake of Purmer. Thence she was carried to Haarlem,
where the Dutch women taught her to spin, and where
several years after, she died in the Roman Catholic faith;&mdash;"but
this," says the pious Calvinistic chaplain, "in no way
militates against the truth of her story." The worthy
minister citing the authority of various writers as proof that
mermaids had in all ages been known in Gaul, Naples,
Epirus, and the Morea, comes to the conclusion that as
there are "sea-cows," "sea-horses," "sea-dogs," as well as
"sea-trees," and "sea-flowers," which he himself had seen,
there are no reasonable grounds for doubt that there may
also be "sea-maidens" and "sea-men."</p>

<p>In an early account of Newfoundland,<a name="Anchor_50_50" id="Anchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">&nbsp;[50]&nbsp;</a> Whitbourne
describes a "maremaid or mareman," which he had seen
"within the length of a pike," and which "came swimming
swiftly towards him, looking cheerfully on his face, as it had
been a woman. By the face, eyes, nose, mouth, chin, ears,
neck and forehead, it appeared to be so beautiful, and in
those parts so well proportioned, having round about the
head many blue streaks resembling hair, but certainly it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19_b" id="Page_19_b">[Pg 19]</a></span>
was no hair. The shoulders and back down to the middle
were square, white, and smooth as the back of a man, and
from the middle to the end it tapered like a broad-hooked
arrow." The animal put both its paws on the side of the
boat wherein its observer sat, and strove much to get in,
but was repelled by a blow.</p>

<p>In 1676, a description was given by an English surgeon
named Glover, of an animal of this kind. The author did
not designate it by any name, but the incident has the
honour of being recorded in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>.<a name="Anchor_51_51" id="Anchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">&nbsp;[51]&nbsp;</a>
About three leagues from the mouth of the river Rappahannock,
in America, while alone in a vessel, he observed, at
the distance of about half a stone-throw, he says, "a most
prodigious creature, much resembling a man, only somewhat
larger, standing right up in the water, with his head, neck,
shoulders, breast and waist, to the cubits of his arms, above
water, and his skin was tawny, much like that of an Indian;
the figure of his head was pyramidal and sleek, without
hair; his eyes large and black, and so were his eyebrows;
his mouth very wide, with a broad black streak on the
upper lip, which turned upwards at each end like
mustachios. His countenance was grim and terrible. His
neck, shoulders, arms, breast and waist, were like unto the
neck, arms, shoulders, breast and waist of a man. His
hands, if he had any, were under water. He seemed to
stand with his eyes fixed on me for some time, and afterwards
dived down, and, a little after, rose at somewhat
a greater distance, and turned his head towards me again,
and then immediately fell a little under water, that I could
discern him throw out his arms and gather them in as a
man does when he swims. At last, he shot with his head
downwards, by which means he cast his tail above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20_b" id="Page_20_b">[Pg 20]</a></span>water, which exactly resembled the tail of a fish, with a
broad fane at the end of it."</p>

<p>Thormodus Torf&aelig;us<a name="Anchor_52_52" id="Anchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">&nbsp;[52]&nbsp;</a> maintains that mermaids are found
on the south coast of Iceland, and, according to Olafsen,<a name="Anchor_53_53" id="Anchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">&nbsp;[53]&nbsp;</a>
two have been taken in the surrounding seas, the first in the
earlier part of the history of that island, and the second in
1733. The latter was found in the stomach of a shark. Its
lower parts were consumed, but the upper were entire.
They were as large as those of a boy eight or nine years
old. Both the cutting teeth and grinders were long and
shaped like pins, and the fingers were connected by a large
web. Olafsen was inclined to believe that these were
human remains, but the islanders all firmly maintained
that they were part of "a marmennill," by which name the
mermaid is known among them.</p>

<p>Of course the worthy bishop of Bergen, Pontoppidan,
has something to tell us about mermaids in his part of
the world. "Amongst the sea monsters," he says,<a name="Anchor_54_54" id="Anchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">&nbsp;[54]&nbsp;</a> "which
are in the North Sea, and are often seen, I shall give the
first place to the Hav-manden, or merman, whose mate
is called Hav-fruen, or mermaid. The existence of this
creature is questioned by many, nor is it at all to be
wondered at, because most of the accounts we have had of
it are mixed with mere fables, and may be looked upon as
idle tales." As such he regards the story told by Jonas
Ramus in his 'History of Norway,' of a mermaid taken by
fishermen at Hordeland, near Bergen, and which is said to
have sung an unmusical song to King Hiorlief. In the
same category he places an account given by Besenius in
his life of Frederic II. (1577), of a mermaid that called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21_b" id="Page_21_b">[Pg 21]</a></span>herself Isbrandt, and held several conversations with a
peasant at Samsoe, in which she foretold the birth of
King Christian IV., "and made the peasant preach repentance
to the courtiers, who were very much given to
drunkenness." Equally "idle" with the above stories is,
in his opinion, another, extracted from an old manuscript
still to be seen in the University Library at Copenhagen,
and quoted by Andrew Buss&aelig;us (1619), of a merman caught
by the two senators, Ulf Rosensparre and Christian Holch,
whilst on their voyage home to Denmark from Norway.
This sea-man frightened the two worshipful gentlemen so
terribly that they were glad to let him go again; for
as he lay upon the deck he spoke Danish to them, and
threatened that if they did not give him his liberty "the ship
should be cast away, and every soul of the crew should
perish."</p>

<p>"When such fictions as these," says Pontoppidan, "are
mixed with the history of the merman, and when that creature
is represented as a prophet and an orator; when they
give the mermaid a melodious voice, and tell us that she is
a fine singer, we need not wonder that so few people of sense
will give credit to such absurdities, or that they even doubt
the existence of such a creature." The good prelate, however,
goes on to say that "whilst we have no ground to believe
all these fables, yet, as to the existence of the creature we
may safely give our assent to it," and, "if this be called in
question, it must proceed entirely from the fabulous stories
usually mixed with the truth." Like Valentyn, he argues
that as there are "sea-horses," "sea-cows," "sea-wolves,"
"sea-dogs," "sea-hogs," etc., it is probable from analogy,
that "we should find in the ocean a fish or creature which
resembles the human species more than any other." As
for the objection "founded on self-love and respect to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22_b" id="Page_22_b">[Pg 22]</a></span>
own species which is honoured with the image of God, who
made man lord of all creatures, and that, consequently, we
may suppose he is entitled to a noble and heavenly form
which other creatures must not partake of," he thinks "its
force vanishes when we consider the form of apes, and
especially of another African creature called 'Quoyas
Morrov' described by Odoard Dapper" in his work on
Africa, and which appears to have been a chimpanzee.
Pontoppidan regarded it as being the Satyr of the ancients.
He therefore claims that "if we will not allow our
Norwegian Hastromber the honourable name of merman,
we may very well call it the 'Sea-ape,' or the 'Sea-Quoyas-Morrov;'"
especially as the author already quoted
says that, "in the Sea of Angola mermaids are frequently
caught which resemble the human species. They are taken
in nets, and killed by the negroes, and are heard to shriek
and cry like women."</p>

<p>The Bishop adds that in the diocese of Bergen, as well
as in the manor of Nordland, there were hundreds of
persons who affirmed with the strongest assurances that
they had seen this kind of creature; sometimes at a distance
and at other times quite close to their boats, standing
upright, and formed like a human creature down to the
middle&mdash;the rest they could not see&mdash;but of those who had
seen them out of water and handled them he had not been
able to find more than one person of credit who could vouch
it for truth. This informant, "the Reverend Mr. Peter
Angel, minister of Vand-Elvens Gield, on Suderoe,"
assured his bishop, when he was on a visitation journey,
that "in the year 1719, he (being then about twenty years
old) saw what is called a merman lying dead on a point of
land near the sea, which had been cast ashore by the waves
along with several sea-calves (seals), and other dead fish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23_b" id="Page_23_b">[Pg 23]</a></span>
The length of this creature was much greater than what
has been mentioned of any before, namely, above three
fathoms. It was of a dark grey colour all over: in the
lower part it was like a fish, and had a tail like that of a
porpoise. The face resembled that of a man, with a mouth,
forehead, eyes, etc. The nose was flat, and, as it were,
pressed down to the face, in which the nostrils were
very visible. The breast was not far from the head; the
arms seemed to hang to the side, to which they were
joined by a thin skin, or membrane. The hands were, to
all appearance, like the paws of a sea-calf. The back of this
creature was very fat, and a great part of it was cut off,
which, with the liver, yielded a large quantity of train-oil."
The author then quotes a description by Luke Debes<a name="Anchor_55_55" id="Anchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">&nbsp;[55]&nbsp;</a> of
a mermaid seen in 1670 at Faroe, westward of Qualboe
Eide, by many of the inhabitants, as also by others from
different parts of Suderoe. She was close to the shore, and
stood there for two hours and a half, and was up to her
waist in water. She had long hairs on her head, which
hung down to the surface of the water all round about her,
and she held a fish in her right hand.</p>

<p>Pontoppidan mentions other instances of similar appearances,
and says that the latest he had heard of was of a
merman seen in Denmark on the 20th of September, 1723,
by three ferrymen who, at some distance from the land,
were towing a ship just arrived from the Baltic. Having
caught sight of something which looked like a dead body
floating on the water, they rowed towards it, and there,
resting on their oars, allowed it to drift close to them. It
sank, but immediately came to the surface again, and then
they saw that it had the appearance of an old man, strong-limbed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24_b" id="Page_24_b">[Pg 24]</a></span>and with broad shoulders, but his arms they could
not see. His head was small in proportion to his body,
and had short, curled, black hair, which did not reach below
his ears; his eyes lay deep in his head, and he had a
meagre and pinched face, with a black, coarse beard, that
looked as if it had been cut. His skin was coarse, and
very full of hair. He stood in the same place for half a
quarter of an hour, and was seen above the water down to
his breast: at last the men grew apprehensive of some
danger, and began to retire; upon which the monster
blew up his cheeks, and made a kind of roaring noise, and
then dived under water, so that they did not see him any
more. One of them, Peter Gunnersen, related (what the
others did not observe) that this merman was, about the
body and downwards, quite pointed, like a fish. This same
Peter Gunnersen likewise deposed that "about twenty years
before, as he was in a boat near Kulleor, the place where
he was born, he saw a mermaid with long hair and large
breasts." He and his two companions were, by command
of the king, examined by the burgomaster of Elsineur,
Andrew Buss&aelig;us, before the privy-councillor, Fridrich von
Gram, and their testimony to the above effect was given
on their respective oaths.</p>

<p>Brave old Henry Hudson, the sturdy and renowned
navigator, who thrice, in three successive years, gave battle
to the northern ice, and was each time defeated in his
endeavour to discover a north-west or north-east passage
to China, though he stamped his name on the title-page
of a mighty nation's history, records the following incident:
"This evening (June 15th) one of our company,
looking overboard, saw a mermaid, and, calling up some of
the company to see her, one more of the crew came up, and
by that time she was come close to the ship's side, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25_b" id="Page_25_b">[Pg 25]</a></span>
earnestly on the men. A little after a sea came and overturned
her. From the navel upward, her back and breasts
were like a woman's, as they say that saw her; her body as
big as one of us, her skin very white, and long hair hanging
down behind, of colour black. In her going down they saw
her tail, which was like the tail of a porpoise and speckled
like a mackarel's. Their names that saw her were Thomas
Hilles and Robert Rayner."</p>

<p>Steller, who was a zoologist of some repute, reports
having seen in Behrings Straits a strange animal, which he
calls a "sea-ape," and in which one might almost recognise
Pontoppidan's "Sea-Quoyas-Morrov." It was about
five feet long, had sharp and erect ears and large eyes,
and on its lips a kind of beard. Its body was thick and
round, and it tapered to the tail, which was bifurcated, with
the upper lobe longest. It was covered with thick hair,
grey on the back, and red on the belly. No feet nor paws
were visible. It was full of frolic, and sported in the
manner of a monkey, swimming sometimes on one side of
the ship and sometimes on the other. It often raised one-third
of its body out of the water, and stood upright for a
considerable time. It would frequently bring up a sea-plant,
not unlike a bottle-gourd, which it would toss about
and catch in its mouth, playing numberless fantastic tricks
with it.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar accounts have been brought from the
Southern Hemisphere, two, at least, of which are worth
transcribing.</p>

<p>Captain Colnett, in his 'Voyage to the South Atlantic,'
says:&mdash;"A very singular circumstance happened off the
coast of Chili, in lat. 24&deg; S., which spread some alarm
amongst my people, and awakened their superstitious apprehensions.
About 8 o'clock in the evening an animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26_b" id="Page_26_b">[Pg 26]</a></span>
rose alongside the ship, and uttered such shrieks and tones
of lamentation, so much like those produced by the female
human voice when expressing the deepest distress as to
occasion no small degree of alarm among those who first
heard it. These cries continued for upwards of three hours,
and seemed to increase as the ship sailed from it. I never
heard any noise whatever that approached so near those
sounds which proceed from the organs of utterance in the
human species."</p>

<p>Captain Weddell, in his 'Voyage towards the South
Pole' (p. 143), writes that one of his men, having been left
ashore on Hall's Island to take care of some produce, heard
one night about ten o'clock, after he had lain down to rest,
a noise resembling human cries. As daylight does not
disappear in those latitudes at the season in which the
incident occurred, the sailor rose and searched along the
beach, thinking that, possibly, a boat might have been upset,
and that some of the crew might be clinging to the detached
rocks.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Roused by that voice of silver sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;From the paved floor he lightly sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And, glaring with his eyes around,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>guided by occasional sounds, he at length saw an object
lying on a rock a dozen yards from the shore, at which he
was somewhat frightened. "The face and shoulders appeared
of human form and of a reddish colour; over the
shoulders hung long green hair; the tail resembled that of
a seal, but the extremities of the arms he could not see
distinctly."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As on the wond'ring youth she smiled,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27_b" id="Page_27_b">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>for the creature continued to make a musical noise during
the two minutes he gazed at it, and, on perceiving him,
disappeared in an instant.</p>

</div>

<p>The universality of the belief in an animal of combined
human and fish-like form is very remarkable. That it
exists amongst the Japanese we have evidence in their
curious and ingeniously-constructed models which are
occasionally brought to this country. I have one of
these which is so exactly the counterpart of that which
my friend Mr. Frank Buckland described, originally in
<i>Land and Water</i>, and which forms the subject of a
chapter in his 'Curiosities of Natural History,'<a name="Anchor_57_57" id="Anchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">&nbsp;[57]&nbsp;</a> that the
portrait of the one (Fig. 13) will equally well represent
the other. The lower half of the body is made of the skin
and scales of a fish of the carp family, and fastened on
to this, so neatly that it is hardly possible to detect where
the joint is made, is a wooden body, the ribs of which are so
prominent that the poor mermaid has a miserable and half-starved
appearance. The upper part of the body is in the
attitude of a Sphinx, leaning upon its elbows and fore-arms.
The arms are thin and scraggy, and the fingers attenuated
and skeleton-like. The nails are formed of small pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28_b" id="Page_28_b">[Pg 28]</a></span>
ivory or bone. The head is like that of a small monkey, and
a little wool covers the crown, so thinly and untidily that if
the mermaid possessed a crystal mirror she would see the
necessity for the vigorous use of her comb of pearl. The
teeth are those of some fish&mdash;apparently of the cat-fish,
(<i>Anarchicas lupus</i>). These Japanese artificial mermaids have
brought many a dollar into the pockets of Mr. Barnum and
other showmen.</p>

<p>Somewhat different in appearance from this, but of the
same kind, was an artificial mermaid described in the
<i>Saturday Magazine</i> of June 4th, 1836.
Fig. 14 is a facsimile of the woodcut
which accompanied it. This grotesque
composition was exhibited in a glass
case, some years previously, "in a
leading street at the west end" of
London. It was constructed "of the
skin of the head and shoulders of a
monkey, which was attached to the
dried skin of a fish of the salmon kind
with the head cut off, and the whole
was stuffed and highly varnished, the
better to deceive the eye." It was
said to have been "taken by the crew
of a Dutch vessel from on board a
native Malacca boat, and from the
reverence shown to it, it was supposed
to be a representative of one of their idol gods." I am
inclined to think that it was of Japanese origin.</p>

JAPANESE.</span>
</div>

<p><a href="#fig02_015">Fig. 15</a> is described in the article above referred to as
having been copied from a Japanese drawing, and as being
a portrait of one of their deities. Its similarity to one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29_b" id="Page_29_b">[Pg 29]</a></span>
those of the Assyrians (<a href="#fig02_002">Fig. 2</a>, page 3) is remarkable. The
inscription, however, does not indicate this. The Chinese
characters in the centre&mdash;"<i>Nin giyo</i>"&mdash;signify "human
fish;" those on the right in Japanese <i>Hira Kana</i>, or running-hand,
have the same purport, and those on the left, in <i>Kata
Kana</i>, the characters of the Japanese alphabet, mean "<i>Ichi
hiru ike</i>"&mdash;"one day kept alive." The whole legend seems
to pretend that this human fish was actually caught, and
kept alive in water for twenty-four hours, but, as the box on
which it is inscribed is one of those in which the Japanese
showmen keep their toys, it was
probably the subject of a
"penny peep-show."</p>

<p>We need not travel from our
own country to find the belief
in mermaids yet existing. It is
still credited in the north of
Scotland that they inhabit the
neighbouring seas: and Dr.
Robert Hamilton, F.R.S.E.,
writing in 1839, expressed emphatically
his opinion that there
was then as much ignorance on this subject as had prevailed
at any former period.<a name="Anchor_58_58" id="Anchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">&nbsp;[58]&nbsp;</a></p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 15.&mdash;A MERMAID. From a
Japanese picture.</span>
</div>

<p>In the year 1797, Mr. Munro, schoolmaster of Thurso,
affirmed that he had seen "a figure like a naked female,
sitting on a rock projecting into the sea, at Sandside Head,
in the parish of Reay. Its head was covered with long,
thick, light-brown hair, flowing down on the shoulders.
The forehead was round, the face plump, and the cheeks
ruddy. The mouth and lips resembled those of a human
being, and the eyes were blue. The arms, fingers, breast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30_b" id="Page_30_b">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and abdomen were as large as those of a full-grown
female," and, altogether,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That sea-nymph's form of pearly light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Was whiter than the downy spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And round her bosom, heaving bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Her glossy yellow ringlets play."<a name="Anchor_59_59" id="Anchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">&nbsp;[59]&nbsp;</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"This creature," continued Mr. Munro, "was apparently
in the act of combing its hair with its fingers, which seemed
to afford it pleasure, and it remained thus occupied during
some minutes, when it dropped into the sea." The Dominie</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"saw the maiden there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Just as the daylight faded,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>but he did not remark whether the fingers were webbed.
On the whole, he infers that this was a marine animal of
which he had a distinct and satisfactory view, and that
the portion seen by him bore a narrow resemblance to the
human form. But for the dangerous situation it had chosen,
and its appearance among the waves, he would have supposed
it to be a woman. Twelve years later, several persons
observed near the same spot an animal which they also
supposed to be a mermaid.</p>

<p>A very remarkable story of this kind is one related by
Dr. Robert Hamilton in the volume already referred to,
and for the general truth of which he vouches, from his
personal knowledge of some of the persons connected with
the occurrence. In 1823 it was reported that some fishermen
of Yell, one of the Shetland group, had captured a mermaid
by its being entangled in their lines. The statement was that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31_b" id="Page_31_b">[Pg 31]</a></span>"the animal was about three feet long, the upper part of the
body resembling the human, with protuberant mamm&aelig;,
like a woman; the face, forehead, and neck were short,
and resembled those of a monkey; the arms, which were
small, were kept folded across the breast; the fingers were
distinct, not webbed; a few stiff, long bristles were on the
top of the head, extending down to the shoulders, and
these it could erect and depress at pleasure, something like
a crest. The inferior part of the body was like a fish.
The skin was smooth, and of a grey colour. It offered no
resistance, nor attempted to bite, but uttered a low, plaintive
sound. The crew, six in number, took it within their boat,
but, superstition getting the better of curiosity, they carefully
disentangled it from the lines and a hook which had
accidentally become fastened in its body, and returned it
to its native element. It instantly dived, descending in a perpendicular
direction." Mr. Edmonston, the original narrator
of this incident, was "a well-known and intelligent observer,"
says Dr. Hamilton, and in a communication made by him
to the Professor of Natural History in the Edinburgh
University gave the following additional particulars, which
he had learned from the skipper and one of the crew of
the boat. "They had the animal for three hours within
the boat: the body was without scales or hair; it was of a
silvery grey colour above, and white below; it was like the
human skin; no gills were observed, nor fins on the back
or belly. The tail was like that of a dog-fish; the mamm&aelig;
were about as large as those of a woman; the mouth and lips
were very distinct, and resembled the human. Not one of
the six men dreamed of a doubt of its being a mermaid,
and it could not be suggested that they were influenced by
their fears, for the mermaid is not an object of terror to
fishermen: it is rather a welcome guest, and danger is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32_b" id="Page_32_b">[Pg 32]</a></span>
apprehended from its experiencing bad treatment." Mr.
Edmonston concludes by saying that "the usual resources
of scepticism that the seals and other sea-animals appearing
under certain circumstances, operating upon an
excited imagination, and so producing ocular illusion,
cannot avail here. It is quite impossible that six Shetland
fishermen could commit such a mistake." It would seem
that the narrator demands that his readers shall be silenced,
if unconvinced; but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He that complies against his will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Is of his own opinion still."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This incident is well-attested, and merits respectful and
careful consideration; but I decline to admit any such impossibility
of error in observation or description on the part
of the fishermen, or the further impossibility of recognising
in the animal captured by them one known to naturalists.
The particulars given in this instance, and also of the
supposed merman seen cast ashore dead in 1719 by the
Rev. Peter Angel (p. 22), are sufficiently accurate descriptions
of a warm-blooded marine animal, with which the
Shetlanders, and probably Mr. Edmonston also, were unacquainted,
namely, the rytina, of which I shall have more
to say presently; and these occurrences afford some slight
hope that this remarkable beast may not have become
extinct in 1768, as has been supposed, but that it may still
exist somewhat further south than it was met with by its
original describer, Steller.</p>

<p>Turning to Ireland, we find the same credence in the
semi-human fish, or fish-tailed human being. In the
autumn of 1819 it was affirmed that "a creature appeared
on the Irish coast, about the size of a girl ten years of age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33_b" id="Page_33_b">[Pg 33]</a></span>
with a bosom as prominent as one of sixteen, having a
profusion of long dark-brown hair, and full, dark eyes. The
hands and arms were formed like those of a man, with a
slight web connecting the upper part of the fingers, which
were frequently employed in throwing back and dividing
the hair. The tail appeared like that of a dolphin." This
creature remained basking on the rocks during an hour, in
the sight of numbers of people, until frightened by the flash
of a musket, when</p>

<p>for it instantly plunged with a scream into the sea.</p>

<p>From Irish legends we learn that those sea-nereids, the
"Merrows," or "Moruachs" came occasionally from the sea,
gained the affections of men, and interested themselves in
their affairs; and similar traditions of the "Morgan" (sea-women)
and the "Morverch" (sea-daughters) are current in
Brittany.</p>

<p>In English poetry the mermaid has been the subject of
many charming verses, and Shakspeare alludes to it in his
plays no less than six times. The head-quarters of these
"daughters of the sea" in England, or of the belief in their
existence, are in Cornwall. There the fisherman, many a

<p>Mr. Robert Hunt, F.R.S., in his collection of the traditions
and superstitions of old Cornwall,<a name="Anchor_63_63" id="Anchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">&nbsp;[63]&nbsp;</a> records several
curious legends of the "merrymaids" and "merrymen" (the
local name of mermaids), which he had gathered from the
fisher-folk and peasants in different parts of that county.</p>

<p>And, in a pleasant article in 'All the Year Round,'<a name="Anchor_64_64" id="Anchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">&nbsp;[64]&nbsp;</a> 1865,
"A Cornish Vicar"<a name="Anchor_65_65" id="Anchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">&nbsp;[65]&nbsp;</a> mentions some of the superstitions of the
people in his neighbourhood, and the perplexing questions
they occasionally put to him. One of his parishioners, an
old man named Anthony Cleverdon, but who was popularly
known as "Uncle Tony," having been the seventh son of
his parents, in direct succession, was looked upon, in consequence,
as a soothsayer. This "ancient augur" confided to
his pastor many highly efficacious charms and formularies,
and, in return, sought for information from him on other
subjects. One day he puzzled the parson by a question
which so well illustrates the local ideas concerning mermaids,
and the sequel of which is, moreover, so humorously
related by the vicar, that I venture to quote his own words,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Uncle Tony said to me, 'Sir, there is one thing I want
to ask you, if I may be so free, and it is this: why should
a merrymaid, that will ride about upon the waters in such
terrible storms, and toss from sea to sea in such ruckles as
there be upon the coast, why should she never lose her
looking-glass and comb?' 'Well, I suppose,' said I, 'that
if there are such creatures, Tony, they must wear their
looking-glasses and combs fastened on somehow, like fins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35_b" id="Page_35_b">[Pg 35]</a></span>to a fish.' 'See!' said Tony, chuckling with delight, 'what
a thing it is to know the Scriptures, like your reverence; I
should never have found it out. But there's another point,
sir, I should like to know, if you please; I've been bothered
about it in my mind hundreds of times. Here be I, that
have gone up and down Holacombe cliffs and streams fifty
years come next Candlemas, and I've gone and watched
the water by moonlight and sunlight, days and nights, on
purpose, in rough weather and smooth (even Sundays, too,
saving your presence), and my sight as good as most men's,
and yet I never could come to see a merrymaid in all my
life: how's that, sir?' 'Are you sure, Tony,' I rejoined,
'that there are such things in existence at all?' 'Oh, sir,
my old father seen her twice! He was out one night for
wreck (my father watched the coast, like most of the old
people formerly), and it came to pass that he was down at
the duck-pool on the sand at low-water tide, and all to
once he heard music in the sea. Well, he croped on
behind a rock, like a coastguardsman watching a boat, and
got very near the music ... and there was the merrymaid,
very plain to be seen, swimming about upon the
waves like a woman bathing&mdash;and singing away. But
my father said it was very sad and solemn to hear&mdash;more
like the tune of a funeral hymn than a Christmas carol, by
far&mdash;but it was so sweet that it was as much as he could do
to hold back from plunging into the tide after her. And
he an old man of sixty-seven, with a wife and a houseful of
children at home. The second time was down here by
Holacombe Pits. He had been looking out for spars&mdash;there
was a ship breaking up in the Channel&mdash;and he saw
some one move just at half-tide mark, so he went on very
softly, step by step, till he got nigh the place, and there
was the merrymaid sitting on a rock, the bootyfullest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36_b" id="Page_36_b">[Pg 36]</a></span>
merrymaid that eye could behold, and she was twisting
about her long hair, and dressing it, just like one of our
girls getting ready for her sweetheart on the Sabbath-day.
The old man made sure he should greep hold of her before
ever she found him out, and he had got so near that a
couple of paces more and he would have caught her by the
hair, as sure as tithe or tax, when, lo and behold, she looked
back and glimpsed him! So, in one moment she dived
head-foremost off the rock, and then tumbled herself topsy-turvy
about in the water, and cast a look at my poor father,
and grinned like a seal.'" And a seal it probably was that
Tony's "poor father" saw.</p>

<p>What, then, are these mermaids and mermen, a belief in
whose existence has prevailed in all ages, and amongst all
the nations of the earth? Have they, really, some of the
parts and proportions of man, or do they belong to another
order of mammals on which credulity and inaccurate
observation have bestowed a false character?</p>

<p>Mr. Swainson, a naturalist of deserved eminence, has
maintained on purely scientific grounds, that there must exist
a marine animal uniting the general form of a fish with that
of a man; that by the laws of Nature the natatorial type
of the <i>Quadrumana</i> is most assuredly wanting, and that,
apart from man, a being connecting the seals with the
monkeys is required to complete the circle of quadrumanous
animals.<a name="Anchor_66_66" id="Anchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">&nbsp;[66]&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Mr. Gosse<a name="Anchor_67_67" id="Anchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">&nbsp;[67]&nbsp;</a> argues that all the characters which Mr.
Swainson selects as marking the natatorial type of animals
belong to man, and that he being, in his savage state, a great
swimmer, is the true aquatic primate, which Mr. Swainson
regards as absent. Mr. Gosse admits, however, that "nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37_b" id="Page_37_b">[Pg 37]</a></span>has an odd way of mocking at our impossibilities, and" that
"it <i>may be</i> that green-haired maidens with oary tails, lurk
in the ocean caves, and keep mirrors and combs upon their
rocky shelves;" and the conclusion he arrives at is that the
combined evidence "induces a strong suspicion that the
northern seas may hold forms of life as yet uncatalogued
by science."</p>

<p>That there are animals in the northern and other seas
with which we are unacquainted, is more than probable:
discoveries of animals of new species are constantly being
made, especially in the life of the deep sea. But I venture
to think that the production of an animal at present
unknown is quite unnecessary to account for the supposed
appearances of mermaids.</p>

<p>We have in the form and habits of the <i>Phocid&aelig;</i>, or earless
seals, a sufficient interpretation of almost every incident of
the kind that has occurred north of the Equator&mdash;of those
in which protuberant <i>mamm&aelig;</i> are described, we must
presently seek another explanation. The round, plump,
expressive face of a seal, the beautiful, limpid eyes, the
hand-like fore-paws, the sleek body, tapering towards the
flattened hinder fins, which are directed backwards, and
spread out in the form of a broad fin, like the tail of a fish,
might well give the idea of an animal having the anterior
part of its body human and the posterior half piscine.</p>

<p>In the habits of the seals, also, we may trace those of the
supposed mermaid, and the more easily the better we are
acquainted with them. All seals are fond of leaving the
water frequently. They always select the flattest and most
shelving rocks which have been covered at high tide, and
prefer those that are separated from the mainland. They
generally go ashore at half-tide, and invariably lie with
their heads towards the water, and seldom more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38_b" id="Page_38_b">[Pg 38]</a></span>
yard or two from it. There they will often remain, if
undisturbed, for six hours; that is, until the returning tide
floats them off the rock. As for the sweet melody,
"so melting soft," that must depend much on the ear and
musical taste of the listener. I have never heard a seal
utter any vocal sounds but a porcine grunt, a plaintive
moan, and a pitiful whine. But another habit of the seals
has, probably more than anything else, caused them to be
mistaken for semi-human beings&mdash;namely, that of poising
themselves upright in the water with the head and the
upper third part of the body above the surface.</p>

<p>One calm sunny morning in August, 1881, a fine schooner-yacht,
on board of which I was a guest, was slowly gliding
out of the mouth of the river Maas, past the Hook of
Holland, into the North Sea, when a seal rose just ahead
of us, and assumed the attitude above described. It waited
whilst we passed it, inspecting us apparently with the
greatest interest; then dived, swam in the direction in
which we were sailing, so as to intercept our course, and
came up again, sitting upright as before. This it repeated
three times, and so easily might it have been taken for a
mermaid, that one of the party, who was called on deck to
see it, thought, at first, that it was a boy who had swam off
from the shore to the vessel on a begging expedition.</p>

<p>Laing, in his account of a voyage to the North, mentions
having seen a seal under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>A young seal which was brought from Yarmouth to the
Brighton Aquarium in 1873, habitually sat thus, showing
his head and a considerable portion of his body out of
water. His bath was so shallow in some parts that he was
able to touch the bottom, and, with his after-flippers tucked
under him, like a lobster's tail, and spread out in front, he
would balance himself on his hind quarters, and look inquisitively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39_b" id="Page_39_b">[Pg 39]</a></span>
at everybody, and listen attentively to everything
within sight and hearing. When he was satisfied
that no one was likely to interfere with him, and that it
was unnecessary to be on the alert, he would half-close his
beautiful, soft eyes, and either contentedly pat, stroke, and
scratch his little fat stomach with his right paw, or flap
both of them across his breast in a most ludicrous manner,
exactly as a cabman warms the tips of his fingers on a
wintry day, by swinging his arms vigorously across his
chest, and striking his hands against his body on either
side. He was very sensitive to musical sounds, as many
dogs are, and when a concert took place in the building a
high note from one of the vocalists would cause him to
utter a mournful wail, and to dive with a splash that made
the water fly, the audience smile, and the singer frown.</p>

<p>Captain Scoresby tells us that he had seen the walrus
with its head above water, and in such a position that it
required little stretch of imagination to mistake it for a
human being, and that on one occasion of this kind the
surgeon of his ship actually reported to him that he had
seen a man with his head above water.</p>

<p>Peter Gunnersen's merman (p. 24), who "blew up his
cheeks and made a kind of roaring noise" before diving,
was probably a "bladder-nose" seal. The males of that
species have on the head a peculiar pad, which they can
dilate at pleasure, and their voice is loud and discordant.</p>

<p>The appearance and behaviour of Steller's "sea-ape,"
described on p. 25, may, I think, be attributed to one of
the eared seals, the so-called sea-lions, or sea-bears. Every
one who has seen these animals fed must have noticed the
rapidity with which they will dive and swim to any part of
their pond where they expect to receive food, and how,
like a dog after a pebble, they will keenly watch their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40_b" id="Page_40_b">[Pg 40]</a></span>
keeper's movements, and start in the direction to which he
is apparently about to throw a fish, even before the latter
has left his hand. This may be seen at the Zoological
Gardens, Regent's Park, and, better than anywhere else in
Europe, at the Jardin d'Acclimatation, Paris. It would be
quite in accordance with their habits that one of these
<i>Otaria</i> should dive under a ship, and rise above the surface
on either side, eagerly surveying those on board, in hope of
obtaining food, or from mere curiosity.</p>

<p>The seals and their movements account for so many
mermaid stories, that all accounts of sea-women with
prominent bosoms were ridiculed and discredited until
competent observers recognised in the form and habits of
certain aquatic animals met with in the bays and estuaries
of the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, the west coast of Africa,
and sub-tropical America, the originals of these "travellers'
tales." These were&mdash;first, the <i>manatee</i>, which is found in
the West Indian Islands, Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, and
Brazil, and in Africa in the River Congo, Senegambia, and
the Mozambique Channel; second, the <i>dugong</i>, or <i>halicore</i>,
which ranges along the east coast of Africa, Southern Asia,
the Bornean Archipelago, and Australia; and, third, the
<i>rytina</i>, seen on Behring's Island in the Kamschatkan Sea
by Steller, the Russian zoologist and voyager, in 1741, and
which is supposed to have become extinct within twenty-seven
years after its discovery, by its having been recklessly
and indiscriminately slaughtered.<a name="Anchor_68_68" id="Anchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">&nbsp;[68]&nbsp;</a> Then science, in the
person of Illeger, made the <i>amende honorable</i>, and frankly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41_b" id="Page_41_b">[Pg 41]</a></span>accepting Jack's introduction to his fish-tailed <i>innamorata</i>,
classed these three animals together as a sub-order of the
animal kingdom, and bestowed on them the name of the
<i>Sirenia</i>. This was, of course, in allusion to the Sirens of
classical mythology, who, in later art, were represented as
having the body of a woman above the waist, and that
of a fish below, although the lower portion of their body
was originally described as being in the form of a bird.</p>

<p>It has been found difficult to determine to which order
these <i>Manatid&aelig;</i> are most nearly allied. In shape they most
closely resemble the whales and seals. But the cetacea
are all carnivorous, whereas the manatee and its relatives
live entirely on vegetable food. Although, therefore, Dr.
J. E. Gray, following Cuvier, classed them with the cetacea
in his British Museum catalogue, other anatomists, as
Professor Agassiz, Professor Owen, and Dr. Murie, regard
their resemblance to the whales as rather superficial than
real, and conclude from their organisation and dentition
that they ought either to form a group apart or be classed
with the pachyderms&mdash;the hippopotamus, tapir, etc.&mdash;with
which they have the nearest affinities, and to which they
seem to have been more immediately linked by the now
lost genera, <i>Dinotherium</i> and <i>Halitherium</i>. With the
opinion of those last-named authorities I entirely agree. I
regard the manatee as exhibiting a wonderful modification
and adaptation of the structure of a warm-blooded land
animal which enables it to pass its whole life in water, and
as a connecting link between the hippopotamus, elephant,
etc., on the one side, and the whales and seals on the other.</p>

<p>The <i>Halitherium</i> was a Sirenian with which we are only
acquainted by its fossil remains found in the Miocene
formation of Central and Southern Europe. These indicate
that it had short hind limbs, and, consequently, approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42_b" id="Page_42_b">[Pg 42]</a></span>
more nearly the terrestrial type than either the manatee,
the rytina, or the dugong, in which the hind limbs are
absent. The two last named tend more than does the
manatee to the marine mammals; but there is a strong
likeness between these three recent forms. They all have
a cylindrical body, like that of a seal, but instead of hind
limbs there is in all a broad tail flattened horizontally; and
the chief difference in their outward appearance is in the
shape of this organ. In the manatee it is rounded, in the
dugong forked like that of a whale, in the rytina crescent-shaped.
The tail of the <i>Halitherium</i> appears to have been
shaped somewhat like that of the beaver. The body of
the manatee is broader in proportion to its length and
depth than that of the dugong. In a paper read before the
Royal Society, July 12th, 1821, on a manatee sent to
London in spirits by the Duke of Manchester, then
Governor of Jamaica, Sir Everard Home remarked of this
greater lateral expansion that, as the manatee feeds on
plants that grow at the mouths of great rivers, and the dugong
upon those met with in the shallows amongst small islands
in the Eastern seas, the difference of form would make the
manatee more buoyant and better fitted to float in fresh
water.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 16.&mdash;THE DUGONG. From Sir J. Emerson Tennent&#39;s &#39;Ceylon.&#39;</span>
</div>

<p>In all the <i>Manatid&aelig;</i> the mamm&aelig; of the female, which
are greatly distended during the period of lactation, are
situated very differently from those of the whales, being
just beneath the pectoral fins. These fins or paws are
much more flexible and free in their movements than
those of the cet&aelig;, and are sufficiently prehensile to enable
the animal to gather food between the palms or inner
surfaces of both, and the female to hold her young one
to her breast with one of them. Like the whales, they are
warm-blooded mammals, breathing by lungs, and are therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43_b" id="Page_43_b">[Pg 43]</a></span>
obliged to come to the surface at frequent intervals
for respiration. As they breathe through nostrils at the
end of the muzzle, instead of, like most of the whales,
through a blow-hole on the top of the head, their habit is
to rise, sometimes vertically, in the water, with the head
and fore part of the body exposed above the surface, and
often to remain in this position for some minutes. When
seen thus, with head and breast bare, and clasping its
young one to its body, the female presents a certain resemblance
to a woman from the waist upward. When
approached or disturbed it dives; the tail and hinder portion
of the body come into view, and we see that if there was
little of the "<i>mulier formosa superne</i>," at any rate "<i>desinit
in piscem</i>." The manatee has thence been called by the
Spaniards and Portuguese the "woman-fish," and by the
Dutch the "manetje," or mannikin. The dugong, having
the muzzle bristly, is named by the latter the "baardmanetje,"
or "little bearded man." There are no bristles
or whiskers on the muzzle of the manatee; all the portraits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44_b" id="Page_44_b">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of it in which these are shown are in that respect erroneous.
The origin of the word "manatee" has by some been
traced to the Spanish, as indicating "an animal with
hands." On the west coast of Africa it is called by the
natives "Ne-hoo-le." By old writers it was described as
the "sea-cow." Gesner depicts it in the act of bellowing;
and Mr. Bates, in his work, "The Naturalist on the
Amazon," says that its voice is something like the bellowing
of an ox. The Florida "crackers" or "mean whites,"
make the same statement. Although I have had opportunities
of prolonged observation of it in captivity, I have
not heard it give utterance to any sound&mdash;not even a grunt&mdash;and
Mr. Bartlett, of the Zoological Gardens, tells me that
his experience of it is the same. His son, Mr. Clarence
Bartlett, says that a young one he had in Surinam used to
make a feeble cry, or bleat, very much like the voice of
a young seal. This is the only sound he ever heard from
a manatee.<a name="Anchor_69_69" id="Anchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">&nbsp;[69]&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>I believe the dugong to be more especially the animal
referred to by &AElig;lian as the semi-human whale, and that
which has led to this group having been supposed by southern
voyagers to be aquatic human beings. In the first place,
the dugong is a denizen of the sea, whereas the manatee
is chiefly found in rivers and fresh-water lagoons; and
secondly, the dugong accords with &AElig;lian's description of
the creature with a woman's face in that it has "prickles
instead of hairs," whilst the manatee has no such stiff
bristles.</p>

<p>In the case of either of these two animals being mistaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45_b" id="Page_45_b">[Pg 45]</a></span>for a mermaid, however, "distance" must "lend enchantment
to the view," and a sailor must be very impressible
and imaginative who, even after having been deprived for
many months of the pleasure of females' society, could be
allured by the charms of a bristly-muzzled dugong, or
mistake the snorting of a wallowing manatee for the love-song
of a beauteous sea-maiden.</p>

</a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 17.&mdash;THE MANATEE. ITS USUAL POSITION.</span>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately both the dugong and the manatee are
being hunted to extinction.</p>

<p>The flesh of the manatee is considered a great delicacy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46_b" id="Page_46_b">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Humboldt compares it with ham. Unlike that of the
whales, which is of a deep and dark red hue, it is as white
as veal, and, it is said, tastes very like it. It is remarkable
for retaining its freshness much longer than other meat,
which in a tropical climate generally putrefies in twenty-eight
hours. It is therefore well adapted for pickling, as
the salt has time to penetrate the flesh before it is tainted.
The Catholic clergy of South America do not object to its
being eaten on fast days, on the supposition that, with
whales, seals, and other aquatic mammals, it may be liberally
regarded as "fish." The "Indians" of the Amazon and
Orinoco are so fond of it that they will spend many days,
if necessary, in hunting for a manatee, and having killed one
will cut it into slabs and slices on the spot, and cook these
on stakes thrust into the ground aslant over a great fire,
and heavily gorge themselves as long as the provision lasts.
The milk of this animal is said to be rich and good, and
the skin is valuable for its toughness, and is much in
request for making leathern articles in which great strength
and durability are required. The tail contains a great
deal of oil, which is believed to be extremely nutritious,
and has also the property of not becoming rancid. Unhappily
for the dugong, its oil is in similarly high repute,
and is greatly preferred as a nutrient medicine to cod-liver
oil. As its flesh also is much esteemed, it is so
persistently hunted on the Australian coasts that it will
probably soon become extinct, like the rytina of Steller.
The same fate apparently awaits the manatee, which is
becoming perceptibly more and more scarce.</p>

<p>I fear that before many years have elapsed the Sirens of
the Naturalist will have disappeared from our earth, before
the advance of civilization, as completely as the fables and
superstitions with which they have been connected, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47_b" id="Page_47_b">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the increase of knowledge; and that the mermaid of fact
will have become as much a creature of the past as the
mermaid of fiction. With regard to the latter&mdash;the Siren of
the poets,&mdash;the water-maiden of the pearly comb, the crystal
mirror, and the sea-green tresses,&mdash;there are few persons I
suppose, at the present day who would not be content to
be classed with Banks, the fine old naturalist and formerly
ship-mate of Captain Cook. Sir Humphry Davy in his
<i>Salmonia</i> relates an anecdote of a baronet, a profound
believer in these fish-tailed ladies, who on hearing some one
praise very highly Sir Joseph Banks, said that "Sir Joseph
was an excellent man, but he had his prejudices&mdash;he did

"prejudice;" and am willing to adopt the further remark

<h2><a name="THE_LERNEAN_HYDRA" id="THE_LERNEAN_HYDRA"></a>THE LERNEAN HYDRA.</h2>


<p>The mystery of the Kraken, of which I treated in a companion
volume to the present, recently published, is not
difficult to unravel. The clue to it is plain, and when
properly taken up is as easily unwound, to arrive at the
truth, as a cocoon of silk, to get at the chrysalis within
it. It was a boorish exaggeration, a legend of ignorance,
superstition, and wonder. But when such a skein of facts
has passed through the hands of the poets, it is sure to be
found in a much more intricate tangle; and many a knot of
pure invention may have to be cut before it is made clear.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we shall be able to discern that more than
one of the most famous and hideous monsters of old
classical lore originated, like the Kraken, in a knowledge by
their authors of the form and habits of those strange sea-creatures,
the head-footed mollusks. There can be little
doubt that the octopus was the model from which the old
poets and artists formed their ideas, and drew their
pictures of the Lernean Hydra, whose heads grew again
when cut off by Hercules; and also of the monster Scylla,
who, with six heads and six long writhing necks, snatched
men off the decks of passing ships and devoured them in
the recesses of her gloomy cavern.</p>

<p>Of the Hydra Diodorus relates that it had a hundred
heads; Simonides says fifty; but the generally received
opinion was that of Apollodorus, Hyginus, and others, that
it had only nine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49_b" id="Page_49_b">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Apollodorus of Athens, son of Asclepiades, who wrote in
stiff, quaint Greek about 120 <small>B.C.</small>, gives in his 'Bibliotheca'
(book ii. chapter 5, section 2) the following account of the
many-headed monster. "This Hydra," he says, "nourished
in the marshes of Lerne, went forth into the open country
and destroyed the herds of the land. It had a huge body
and nine heads, eight mortal, but the ninth immortal.
Having mounted his chariot, which was driven by Iolaus,
Hercules got to Lerne and stopped his horses. Finding
the Hydra on a certain raised ground near the source of the
Amymon, where its lair was, he made it come out by pelting
it with burning missiles. He seized and stopped it, but
having twisted itself round one of his feet, it struggled with
him. He broke its head with his club: but that was useless;
for when one head was broken two sprang up, and a
huge crab helped the Hydra by biting the foot of Hercules.
This he killed, and called Iolaus, who, setting on fire part
of the adjoining forest, burned with torches the germs of
the growing heads, and stopped their development. Having
thus out-man&oelig;uvred the growing heads, he cut off the
immortal head, buried it, and put a heavy stone upon it,
beside the road going from Lerne to Eleonta, and having
opened the Hydra, dipped his arrows in its gall."</p>

<p>If we wish to find in nature the counterpart of this
Hydra, we must seek, firstly, for an animal with eight out-growths
from its trunk, which it can develop afresh, or
replace by new ones, in case of any or all of them being
amputated or injured. We must also show that this
animal, so strange in form and possessing such remarkable
attributes, was well known in the locality where the legend
was believed. We have it in the octopus, which abounded
in the Mediterranean and &AElig;gean seas, and whose eight
prehensile arms, or tentacles, spring from its central body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50_b" id="Page_50_b">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the immortal head, and which, if lost or mutilated by
misadventure, are capable of reproduction.</p>

<p>That a knowledge of the octopus existed at a very early
period of man's history we have abundant evidence. The
ancient Egyptians figured it amongst their hieroglyphics,
and an interesting proof that they were also acquainted
with other cephalopods was given to me by the late
Mr. E. W. Cooke, R.A. Whilst on a trip up the Nile, in
January, 1875, he visited the temple of Bayr-el-Bahree,
Thebes (date 1700 <small>B.C.</small>), the entrance to which had been
deeply buried beneath the light, wind-drifted sand, accumulated
during many centuries. By order of the Khedive,
access had just at that time been obtained to its interior,
by the excavation and removal of this deep deposit, and,
amongst the hieroglyphics on the walls, were found, between
the zig-zag lines which represent water, figures of various
fishes, copies of which Mr. Cooke kindly gave me, and
which are so accurately portrayed as to be easily identified.
With them was the outline of a squid fourteen inches long,
a figure of which, from Mr. Cooke's drawing, is here shown.
As this temple is five hundred miles from the delta of the
Nile, it is remarkable that nearly all the fishes there represented
are of marine species.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51_b" id="Page_51_b">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>That the octopus was a familiar object with the
ancient Greeks, we know by the frequency with which its
portrait is found on their coins, gems, and ornaments.
Aldrovandus describes "very ancient coins" found at
Syracuse and Tarentum bearing the figure of an octopus.
He says the Syracusans had two coins, one of bronze, the
other of gold, both of which had an octopus alone on one
side. On the reverse of the bronze one was a veiled
female face in profile, with the inscription [Greek: SURA]. I have one
of these bronze Syracusan coins; it was kindly given to
me, some years ago, by my friend, Dr. John Millar, F.L.S.
The octopus is really well depicted. On the gold coin the
female head was differently veiled, and at the back of the
neck was a fish. The inscription on this coin was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52_b" id="Page_52_b">[Pg 52]</a></span>
[Greek: SURAKOSI&Ocirc;N]. Goltzius was of the opinion that the head
was that of Arethusa. The coins found at Tarentum had
on one side a figure of Neptune seated on a dolphin, and
holding an octopus in one hand and a trident in the
other.</p>

<p>Lerne, or Lerna, the reputed home of the Hydra, was a
port of Southern Greece, situated at the head of the Gulf
of Nauplia, and between the existing towns of Argos and
Tripolitza. Within a few miles of it was Mycen&aelig;; and it
is remarkable that Dr. Schliemann, during his excavations
there in 1876, found in a tomb a gold plate, or button, two
and a half inches in diameter (Fig. 19), on which is figured an
octopus, the eight arms of which are converted into spirals,
the head and the two eyes being distinctly visible. In
another sepulchre he discovered fifty-three golden models
of the octopus (Fig. 20), all exactly alike, and apparently
cast in the same mould. The arms are very naturally
carved. By the kindness of Mr. Murray, his publisher, I am
enabled to give illustrations of these and two other
handsome ornaments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53_b" id="Page_53_b">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Having ascertained that the octopus was a familiar
object in the very locality where the combat between
Hercules and the Hydra is supposed to have taken place,
let us compare the animal as it exists with the monstrous
offspring of Typhon and Echidna.</p>

<p>It is a not uncommon occurrence that when an octopus
is caught it is found to have one or more of its arms shorter
than the rest, and showing marks of having been amputated,
and of the formation of a new growth from the old cicatrix.
Several such specimens were brought to the Brighton
Aquarium whilst I had charge of its Natural History
Department. One of them was particularly interesting. Two
of its arms had evidently been bitten off about four inches
from the base: and out from the end of each healed stump
(which in proportion to the length of the limb was as if
a man's arm had been amputated halfway between the
shoulder and the elbow), grew a slender little piece of newly-formed
arm, about as large as a lady's stiletto, or a small
button-hook&mdash;in fact just the equivalent of worthy Captain
Cuttle's iron hook, which did duty for his lost hand. It
was an illustrative example of the commencement of the
repair and restoration of mutilated limbs.</p>

<p>This mutilation is so common in some localities, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54_b" id="Page_54_b">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Professor Steenstrup says<a name="Anchor_70_70" id="Anchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">&nbsp;[70]&nbsp;</a> that almost every octopus he
has examined has had one or two arms reproduced; and
that he has seen females in which all the eight arms had
been lost, but were more or less restored. He also
mentions a male in which this was the case as to seven of its
arms. He adds that whilst the <i>Octopoda</i> possess the power
of reproducing with great facility and rapidity their arms,
which are exposed to so many enemies, the <i>Decapoda</i>&mdash;the
<i>Sepiid&aelig;</i> and Squids&mdash;appear to be incapable of thus
repairing and replacing accidental injuries. This is
entirely in accord with my own observations.</p>

<p>This reparative power is possessed by some other animals,
of which the starfishes and crustacea are the most familiar
instances. In the case of the lobster or crab, however, the
only joint from which new growth can start is that connected
with the body, so that if a limb be injured in any
part, the whole of it must be got rid of, and the animal has,
therefore, the power of casting it off at will. The octopus,
on the contrary, is incapable of voluntary dismemberment,
but reproduces the lost portion of an injured arm, as an
out-growth from the old stump.</p>

<p>The ancients were well acquainted with this reparative
faculty of the octopus: but of course the simple fact was
insufficient for an imaginative people: and they therefore
embellished it with some fancies of their own. There
lingers still amongst the fishermen of the Mediterranean a
very old belief that the octopus when pushed by hunger
will gnaw and devour portions of its arms. Aristotle knew
of this belief, and positively contradicted it; but a fallacy
once planted is hard to eradicate. You may cut it down,
and apparently destroy it, root and branch, but its seeds
are scattered abroad, and spring up elsewhere, and in unexpected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55_b" id="Page_55_b">[Pg 55]</a></span>places. Accordingly, we find Oppian, more than
five centuries later, disseminating the same old notion, and
comparing this habit of the animal with that of the bear
obtaining nutriment from his paws by sucking them during
his hybernation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">&nbsp;Life to preserve and be himself the feast."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fact is, that the larger predatory fishes regard an
octopus as very acceptable food, and there is no better
bait for many of them than a portion of one of its arms.
Some of the cetacea also are very fond of them, and
whalers have often reported that when a "fish" (as they
call it) is struck it disgorges the contents of its stomach,
amongst which they have noticed parts of the arms of
cuttles which, judging from the size of their limbs, must
have been very large specimens. The food of the sperm
whale consists largely of the gregarious squids, and
the presence in spermaceti of their undigested beaks is
accepted as a test of its being genuine. That old fish-reptile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56_b" id="Page_56_b">[Pg 56]</a></span>the Ichthyosaurus, also, preyed upon them; and
portions of the horny rings of their suckers were discovered
in its coprolites by Dean Buckland. Amongst the worst
enemies of the octopus is the conger. They are both rock-dwellers,
and if the voracious fish come upon his cephalopod
neighbour unseen, he makes a meal of him, or, failing to
drag him from his hold, bites off as much of one or two
of his arms as he can conveniently obtain. The conger,
therefore, is generally the author of the injury which the
octopus has been unfairly accused of inflicting on itself.</p>

<p>Continuing our comparison with the hydra, we have in
the octopus an animal capable of quitting its rocky lurking-place
in the sea, and going on a buccaneering expedition
on dry land. Many incidents have been related in connection
with this; but I can attest it from my own observation.
I have seen an octopus travel over the floor of a
room at a very fair rate of speed, toppling and sprawling
along in its own ungainly fashion; and in May, 1873, we
had one at the Brighton Aquarium which used regularly
every night to quit its tank, and make its way along the
wall to another tank at some distance from it, in which
were some young lump-fishes. Day after day, one of these
was missing, until, at last, the marauder was discovered.
Many days elapsed, however, before he was detected, for
after helping himself to, and devouring a young "lump-sucker,"
he demurely returned before daylight to his own
quarters.</p>

<p>Of this habit of the octopus the ancients were, also, fully
aware. Aristotle wrote that it left the water and walked
in stony places, and Pliny and &AElig;lian related tales of
this animal stealing barrels of salt fish from the wharves,
and crushing their staves to get at the contents. An
octopus that could do this would be as formidable a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57_b" id="Page_57_b">[Pg 57]</a></span>
predatory monster as the Lernean Hydra, which had the
evil reputation of devouring the Peloponnesian cattle.</p>

<p>Whoever first described the counter-attack of the Hydra
on Hercules must have had the octopus in his thoughts. "It
twisted itself round one of his feet"&mdash;exactly that which an
octopus would do.</p>

</div>

<p>Finally, according to the legend, Hercules dipped his
arrow-heads in the gall of the Hydra, and, from its poisonous
nature, all the wounds he inflicted with them upon his
enemies proved fatal. It is worthy of notice that the
ancients attributed to the octopus the possession of a
similarly venomous secretion. Thus Oppian writes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The crawling preke a deadly juice contains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Injected poison fires the wounded veins."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The accompanying illustration (Fig. 23) of Hercules
slaying the Hydra is taken from a marble tablet in the
Vatican. It will be immediately seen how closely the
Hydra, as there depicted, resembles an octopus. The body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58_b" id="Page_58_b">[Pg 58]</a></span>
is elongated, but the eight necks with small heads on them
bear about the same proportion to the body as the arms to
the body of an octopus.</p>

<p>The Reverend James Spence, in his 'Polymetis,' published
in 1755, gives a figure, almost the counterpart of this,
copied from an antique gem, a carnelian, in the collection of
the Grand Duke of Tuscany at Florence. Only seven
necks of the hydra are, however, there visible, and there
are two coils in the elongated body. On the upper part
are two spots which have been supposed to represent
breasts. This was probably intended by the artificer; but
that the idea originated from a duplication of the syphon
tube is evident from the figures (Figs. 21, 22) of the octopus
on the smaller gold ornaments found by Dr. Schliemann at
Mycen&aelig;. In the same work is also an engraving from a
picture in the Vatican Virgil, entitled 'The River, or
Hateful Passage into the Kingdom of Ades,' wherein an
octopus-hydra, of which only six heads and necks are
shown, is one of the monsters called by the author "Terrors
of the Imagination."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59_b" id="Page_59_b">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>In the description given by Homer, in the twelfth book of
the 'Odyssey,' of the unfortunate nymph Scylla, transformed
by the arts of Circe into a frightful monster, the same
typical idea as in the case of the Hydra is perceptible. The
lurking octopus, having its lair in the cranny of a rock,
watching in ambush for passing prey, seizing anything
coming within its reach with one or more of its prehensile
arms, even brandishing these fear-inspiring weapons out of
water in a threatening manner, and known in some localities
to be dangerous to boats and their occupants, is transformed
into a many-headed sea monster, seizing in its
mouths, instead of by the adhesive suckers of its numerous
arms, the helpless sailors from passing vessels, and devouring
them in the abysses of its cavernous den.</p>

<p>Circe, prophesying to Ulysses the dangers he had still to
encounter, warned him especially of Scylla and Charybdis,
within the power of one of whom he must fall in passing
through the narrow strait (between Italy and Sicily) where
they had their horrid abode. Describing the lofty rock of
Scylla, she tells him:</p>

<p>One of the sea-fallacies still generally believed, and accepted
as true, is that whales take in water by the mouth, and
eject it from the spiracle, or blow-hole.</p>

<p>The popular ideas on this subject are still those which
existed hundreds of years ago, and which are expressed by
Oppian in two passages in his 'Halieutics':</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Uncouth the sight when they in dreadful play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Discharge their nostrils and refund a sea,"<br /></span>

<p>Eminent zoologists and intelligent observers, who have
had full opportunities of obtaining practical knowledge of
the habits of these great marine mammals, have forcibly
combated and repeatedly contradicted this erroneous idea;
but their sensible remarks have been read by few, in comparison
with the numbers of those to whom a wrong impression
has been conveyed by sensational pictures in which
whales are represented <i>with their heads above the surface</i>,
and throwing up from their nostrils columns of water, like
the fountains in Trafalgar Square. One can hardly be
surprised that the old writers on Natural History were unacquainted
with the real composition of the whale's "spout."
Those of them who sought for any original information on
marine zoology, obtained it chiefly from uninstructed and
superstitious fishermen; but they generally contented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63_b" id="Page_63_b">[Pg 63]</a></span>
themselves with diligent compilation, and thus copied and
transmitted the errors of their predecessors, with the
addition of some slight embellishments of their own. Accordingly,
we find Olaus Magnus<a name="Anchor_73_73" id="Anchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">&nbsp;[73]&nbsp;</a> describing, as follows,
the <i>Physeter</i>, or, as his translator, Streater, calls it, the
<i>Whirlpool</i>. "The <i>Physeter</i> or <i>Pristis</i>," he says, "is a kind
of whale, two hundred cubits long, and is very cruel. For,
to the danger of seamen, he will sometimes raise himself
above the sail-yards, and casts such floods of waters above
his head, which he had sucked in, that with a cloud of them
he will often sink the strongest ships, or expose the mariners
to extreme danger. This beast hath also a large round
mouth, like a lamprey, whereby he sucks in his meat or
water, and by his weight cast upon the fore or hinder deck,
he sinks and drowns a ship."</p>

<p>Figures 24 and 25 (p. 64) are facsimiles of the illustrations
which accompany the above description. It will be seen
that, in the first, the <i>Physeter</i> is depicted as uprearing a
maned neck and head, like that of a fabled dragon; whilst
in <a href="#fig02_025">Fig. 25</a> it is shown as a whale flinging itself on board a
ship, which is sinking under its ponderous weight. In
both, torrents of water are issuing from its head, and it is
evident that they are merely exaggerated misrepresentations
of the "spouting" of whales.</p>

<p>Gesner copies many of Olaus Magnus's illustrations, and
improves upon Fig. 25 by putting a numerous crew on
board the ship. The unfortunate sailors are depicted in
every attitude of terror and despair, and seem to be incapacitated
from any attempt to save themselves by the
flood of water which the whale is deliberately pouring upon
them from its blow-holes.</p>

</div>

<p>These old pictures appear, no doubt, ridiculous, but they
are, really, very little more absurd and untrue to nature
than many of those which disfigure some otherwise useful
books on Natural History of the present day. I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65_b" id="Page_65_b">[Pg 65]</a></span>
refer to several, in which whales are represented as spouting
from their blow-holes one or more columns of water, which,
after ascending skyward to a considerable distance, fall
over gracefully as if issuing from the nozzle of an ornamental
fountain. I select one from amongst them (Fig. 26), not with
any disrespect for the artist, author, or publisher of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66_b" id="Page_66_b">[Pg 66]</a></span>
from which it is taken, but because, whilst it shows correctly
the position of the blow-hole of the sperm whale, it also exhibits
exactly that which I wish to confute. The publishers
of the valuable work in which this picture appeared have
generously consented to my reproducing it here.</p>

<p>When, in describing, in 1877, the White Whale then exhibited
at the Westminster Aquarium, I said that whales
do not spout water out of their blow-holes, and that the
idea that they do so is a popular error, the statement was
so contrary to generally-accepted notions that I was not
surprised by receiving more than one letter on the subject.
One very reasonable suggestion made to me was that,
although the lesser whales, such as the porpoises, which I
had had opportunities of watching in confinement at
Brighton for two years, and the <i>Beluga</i>, which had been
observed for a similar period at the New York Aquarium,
and also at Westminster, did not "spout," the respiratory
apparatus of the larger whales might be so modified as to
permit them to do so. Let us consider the construction of
the breathing apparatus which would have to be thus
modified, as shown in the porpoise.</p>

<p>In the first place, there is a pair of lungs as perfect as
those of any land mammal, fitted to receive air, and to
bring the hot blood into contact with the air, that it may
absorb the oxygen of the air, and so be purified. But this
air cannot well be breathed through the mouth of an
animal which has to take its food from and in water; so it
has to be inhaled only by the nostrils. If these were
situated as they are in land mammals, near the extremity
of the nose, the porpoise would be obliged to stop when
pursuing its prey, or, escaping from its enemies, to put the
tip of its nose above the surface of the water every time it
required to breathe. A much more convenient arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67_b" id="Page_67_b">[Pg 67]</a></span>
has, therefore, been provided for it, and for almost all
whales, by which that difficulty is removed. Instead of
running along the bones of the nose, the nostrils are placed
on the top of the head, and the windpipe is turned up to
them without having any connection with the palate. The
upper jaw is quite solid. Thus the mouth is solely devoted
to the reception of food, and the animal is enabled to continue
its course when swimming, however rapidly, by rising
obliquely to the surface, and exposing the top of its head
above it. On the blow-hole being opened, the air, from
which the oxygen has been absorbed, is expelled in a
sudden puff, another supply is instantaneously inhaled, and
rushes into the lungs with extreme velocity, and then the
porpoise can either descend into the depths, or remain with
its spiracle exposed to the air, as it may prefer. In this
act of breathing the spiracle is normally brought above the
water, the breath escapes, and the immediate inhalation is
effected almost in silence. But frequently, and in some
whales habitually, the blow-hole is opened just below the
surface, and then the outrush of air causes a splash upwards
of the water overlying it.</p>

<p>I may here mention that I have frequently seen the
porpoises at the Brighton Aquarium lying asleep at the
surface, with the blow-hole exposed above it, breathing
automatically, and without conscious effort. Aristotle was
acquainted with this habit of the cetacea 2,200 years ago,
for he wrote: "They sleep with the blow-hole, their organ
of respiration, elevated above the water."</p>

<p>The apparatus for closing the blow-hole, so that not a
drop of water shall enter the windpipe, even under great
pressure, is a beautiful contrivance, complex in its structure,
yet most simple in its working. The external aperture is
covered by a continuation of the skin, locally thickened, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68_b" id="Page_68_b">[Pg 68]</a></span>
connected with a conical stopper, of a texture as tough as
india-rubber, which fits perfectly into a cone or funnel
formed by the extremity of the windpipe, and closes more
and more firmly as the pressure upon it is increased.
Whilst the orifice is thus guarded, the lower end of the
tube is surrounded by a strong compressing muscle, which
clasps also the glottis, and thus the passage from the blow-hole
to the lungs is completely stopped.</p>

<p>There is nothing in this which indicates the possibility of
the spouting of water from the nostrils; but as assertions
that water had been seen to issue from them were positive
and persistent, anatomists seem to have felt themselves
obliged to try to account for it somehow. Accordingly
the theory was propounded by F. Cuvier that the water
taken into the mouth is reserved in two pouches (one on
each side), until the whale rises to blow, when, the gullet
being closed, it is forced by the action of the tongue and
jaws through the nasal passages, somewhat as a smoker
occasionally expels the smoke of his cigar through his
nostrils. Although these pouches, or sacs analogous to
them, are found at the base of the nostrils of the horse,
tapir, etc.,&mdash;animals which do not "spout" from the nostrils
water taken in by the mouth&mdash;the explanation was accepted
for a time.</p>

<p>Mr. Bell held this opinion when the first edition of his
'British Quadrupeds' was published in 1837, but before
the issue of the second edition, in 1874, he had found
reasons for taking a different view of the matter; and,
under the advice of his judicious editors, Mr. Alston, and
Professor Flower (the latter of whom supervised the proofs
of the chapters on the Cetacea) his sanction of the illusion
was withdrawn as follows:&mdash;"The results of more recent
and careful observations, amongst which we may notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69_b" id="Page_69_b">[Pg 69]</a></span>
those of Bennett, Von Baer, Sars and Burmeister, are directly
opposed to the statement that water is thus ejected; and
there can now be no doubt that the appearance which has
given rise to the idea is caused by the moisture with which
the expelled breath is supercharged, which condenses at
once in the cold outer air, and forms a cloud or column of
white vapour. It is possible indeed that if the animal
begins to 'blow' before its head is actually at the surface,
the force of the rushing air may drive up some little spray
along with it, but this is quite different from the notion that
water is really expelled from the nasal passages. We may
add that on the only occasion when we ourselves witnessed
the 'spouting' of a large whale we were much struck with
its resemblance to the column of white spray which is
dashed up by the ricochetting ball fired from one of the
great guns of a man-of-war."</p>

<p>The simile is admirable, and nothing could better describe
the appearance of a whale's "spout"; but, in the previous
portion of the passage (except with reference to the sperm
whale, the nostrils of which are not on the top of the head),
I think sufficient importance is not conceded to the volume
of water propelled into the air by the outrush of breath
from the submerged blow-hole. I do not know how many
cubic feet of air the lungs of a great whale are capable of
containing, but the quantity is sufficient to force up to a
height of several feet the water above the valve when the
latter is opened, not only in "some little spray," but, for some
distance in a good solid jet&mdash;enough, in fact, to give the
appearance of its actually issuing from the blow-hole, and
to account for the erroneous belief of sailors that it does so.
It must be remembered that the escape of air is not by a
prolonged wheeze, but by a sudden blast, and thus when
the spiracle is opened just beneath the surface, an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70_b" id="Page_70_b">[Pg 70]</a></span>
before it is uncovered to take in a fresh supply of air, the
water above its orifice is thrown up as by a slight subaqueous
explosion, or as by the momentary opening under
water of the safety-valve of a steam boiler. Some idea of
the force and volume of the blast of air from the lungs of
even the common porpoise may be formed when I mention
that one of the porpoises at the Brighton Aquarium,
happening to open its spiracle just beneath an illuminating
gas jet fixed over its tank, blew out the light.</p>

<p>In the sperm whale the nostrils are placed near the
extremity of the nose, and therefore this whale has to raise
its snout above the surface when it requires to breathe;
but instead of this being necessary, as in the case of the
porpoise twice or thrice in a minute, the sperm whale only
rises to "blow" at intervals of from an hour to an hour and
twenty minutes. Mr. Beale says<a name="Anchor_74_74" id="Anchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">&nbsp;[74]&nbsp;</a> that in a large bull sperm
whale the time consumed in making one expiration and one
inspiration is ten seconds, during six of which the nostril is
beneath the surface of the water&mdash;the expiration occupying
three seconds, and the inspiration one second. At each
breathing time this whale makes from sixty to seventy
expirations, and remains, therefore, at the surface ten or
eleven minutes, and then, raising its tail, it descends
perpendicularly, head first. In different individuals the
time required for performing these several acts varies; but
in each they are minutely regular, and this well-known
regularity is of considerable use to the fishers, for when a
whaler has once noticed the periods of any particular whale
which is not alarmed, he knows to a minute when to expect
it to come to the surface, and how long it will remain there.
The "spout" of the sperm whale differs much from that of
other whales. Unlike, for instance, the straight perpendicular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71_b" id="Page_71_b">[Pg 71]</a></span>
twin jets of the "right whale," the single, forward-slanting
"spout" of the sperm whale presents a thick curled
bush of white mist. Each whale has a different mode and
time of breathing, and the form of the "spout" differs
accordingly.</p>

<p>It is said that the blowing of the <i>Beluga</i>, or "White
Whale," is not unmusical at sea, and that when it takes
place under water it often makes a peculiar sound which
might be mistaken for the whistling of a bird. Hence is
derived one of the names given to this whale by sailors&mdash;the
"Sea-canary." Though I have had opportunities of
attentively watching the breathing and other actions in
captivity of two specimens of this whale I have never been
able to detect the sound alluded to.</p>

<p>Besides the opinions cited by Mr. Bell concerning whales
spouting water from their blow-holes, we have other
evidence which is most clear and definite, and which ought
to be convincing.</p>

<p>We will take first that of Mr. Beale, who as surgeon on
board the "Kent" and "Sarah and Elizabeth," South Sea
whalers, passed several seasons amongst sperm whales.
He says:&mdash;"I can truly say when I find myself in opposition
to these old and received notions, that out of the
thousands of sperm whales which I have seen during my
wanderings in the South and North Pacific Oceans, I have
never observed one of them to eject a column of water from
the nostril. I have seen them at a distance, and I have
been within a few yards of several hundreds of them, and
I never saw water pass from the spout-hole. But the
column of thick and dense vapour which is certainly
ejected is exceedingly likely to mislead the judgment of
the casual observer in these matters; and this column does
indeed appear very much like a jet of water when seen at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72_b" id="Page_72_b">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the distance of one or two miles on a clear day, because of
the condensation of the vapour which takes place the
moment it escapes from the nostril, and its consequent
opacity, which makes it appear of a white colour, and
which is not observed when the whale is close to the spectator.
It then appears only like a jet of white steam.
The only water in addition is the small quantity that may
be lodged in the external fissure of the spout hole, when
the animal raises it above the surface to breathe, and which
is blown up into the air with the 'spout,' and may probably
assist in condensing the vapour of which it is
formed.... I have been also very close to the <i>Bal&aelig;na
mysticetus</i> (the Greenland, or Right whale) when it has been
feeding and breathing, and yet I never saw even that
animal differ in the latter respect from the sperm whale in
the nature of the spout.... If the weather is fine and
clear, and there is a gentle breeze at the time, the spout
may be seen from the masthead of a moderate-sized vessel
at the distance of four or five miles."</p>

<p>Captain Scoresby, who was a veteran and successful
whaler, a good zoologist, and a highly intelligent observer,
says:&mdash;"A moist vapour mixed with mucus is discharged
from the nostrils when the animal breathes; but no water
accompanies it unless an expiration of the breath be made
under the surface."</p>

<p>Dr. Robert Brown, who communicated to the Zoological
Society, in May, 1868, a valuable series of observations on
the mammals of Greenland, made during his voyages to the
Spitzbergen, Iceland, and Jan Mayen Seas, and along the
eastern and western shores of Davis's Strait and Baffin's
Bay to near the mouth of Smith's Sound, remarks, in a
chapter on the Right whale (<i>Bal&aelig;na mysticetus</i>):&mdash;"The
'blowing,' so familiar a feature of the <i>Cetacea</i>, but especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73_b" id="Page_73_b">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of the <i>Mysticetus</i> is, quite analogous to the breathing
of the higher mammals, and the blow-holes are the homologues
of the nostrils. It is most erroneously stated that
the whale ejects water from the blow-holes. I have been
many times only a few feet from a whale when 'blowing,'
and, though purposely observing it, could never see that it
ejected from its nostrils anything but the ordinary breath&mdash;a
fact which might almost have been deduced from analogy.
In the cold arctic air this breath is generally condensed, and
falls upon those close at hand in the form of a dense spray
which may have led seamen to suppose that this vapour
was originally ejected in the form of water. Occasionally,
when the whale blows just as it is rising out of or sinking in
the sea, a little of the superincumbent water may be forced
upwards by the column of breath. When the whale is
wounded in the lungs, or in any of the blood-vessels immediately
supplying them, blood, as might be expected, is
ejected in the death-throes along with the breath. When
the whaleman sees his prey 'spouting red,' he concludes
that its end is not far distant; it is then mortally wounded."</p>

<p>Captain F. C. Hall, the commander of the unfortunate
"Polaris" Expedition, thus describes, in his 'Life with the
Esquimaux,' the spout of a whale:&mdash;"What this blowing is
like," he says, "may be described by asking if the reader
has ever seen the smoke produced by the firing of an old-fashioned
flint-lock. If so, then he may understand the
'blow' of a whale&mdash;a flash in the pan and all is over."</p>

<p>Captain Scammon, an experienced American whaling
captain, who, like Scoresby, could wield well both harpoon
and pen, in his fine work on 'The Marine Mammals of the
North-Western Coast of America,' writes to the same
effect.</p>

<p>Mr. Herman Melville, who is not a naturalist, but
has served before the mast in a sperm-whaler and borne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74_b" id="Page_74_b">[Pg 74]</a></span>
his part in all the hardships and dangers of the chase,
writes, in his remarkable book, 'The Whale':&mdash;"As for
this 'whale-spout' you might almost stand in it, and yet be
undecided as to what it is precisely. Nor is it at all prudent
for the hunter to be over curious respecting it. For, even
when coming into slight contact with the outer vapoury
shreds of the jet, which will often happen, your skin will
feverishly smart from the acrimony of the thing so touching
you. And I know one who, coming into still closer
contact with the spout&mdash;whether with some scientific
object in view or otherwise I cannot say&mdash;the skin peeled
off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen,
the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. I
have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the
jet were fairly spouted into your eyes it would blind you."</p>

<p>The only other eye-witness I will cite is Mr. Bartlett, of
the Zoological Gardens, whose experience and accuracy as
an observer of the habits of animals is unsurpassed. He
spent an autumn holiday in accompanying the late Mr.
Frank Buckland and his colleagues, Messrs. Walpole and
Young, in a tour of inquiry into the condition of the
herring fishery in Scotland. When the commissioners
left Peterhead, he remained there for a few days as the
guest of Captain David Gray, of the steam whaler,
"Eclipse," and as it was reported that large whales had
been seen in the offing, his host invited him to go in search
of them, and pay them a visit in his steam-launch. When
about twelve miles out, they saw the whales, which were
"finners," at a distance of four or five miles. Fourteen
were counted&mdash;all large ones&mdash;some of which were seventy
feet in length. On approaching them the captain shut off
steam, and the launch was allowed to float in amongst
them. So close were they to the boat that it would not
have been difficult to jump upon the back of one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75_b" id="Page_75_b">[Pg 75]</a></span>
had that been desirable. Mr. Bartlett tells me that he was
greatly astonished by the immense force of the sudden outrush
of air from their blow-holes, and the noise by which it
was accompanied. He believes that the blast was strong
enough to blow a man off the spiracle if he were seated on
it. He authorizes me to say that having seen and watched
these whales under such favourable circumstances, he
entirely agrees with all that I have here written concerning
the so-called "spout." The volume of hot, vaporous breath
expelled is enormous, and this is accompanied by no small
quantity of water, forced up by it when the blow-hole is
opened below the surface.</p>

<p>An effect similar in appearance to the whale's spout is
produced by the breathing of the hippopotamus. When
this great beast opens its nostrils beneath the surface,
water and spray are driven and scattered upward by the
force of the air, but, of course, do not issue from the nasal
passages. I have, also, seen this effect produced, though
in a less degree, by the breathing of sea-lions.</p>

<p>I repeat, therefore, that not a drop of sea-water enters or
passes out of the blow-hole of a whale. If the spiracle
valve were in a condition to allow it to do so the animal
would soon be drowned. Everyone knows the extreme
irritation and the horrible feeling of suffocation caused to
a human being, whilst eating or drinking, by a crumb or a
little liquid "going the wrong way"&mdash;that is, being accidentally
drawn to the air-passages instead of passing to the
&oelig;sophagus. If water were to enter the bronchi of a whale
it would instantly produce similar discomfort.</p>

<p>The neck of a popular error is hard to break; but it is
time that one so palpable as that concerning the "spouting"
of whales should cease to be promulgated and disseminated
by fanciful illustrations of instructive books.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76_b" id="Page_76_b">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the prettiest fables of the sea is that relating to the
Paper Nautilus, the constructor and inhabitant of the
delicate and beautiful shell which looks as if it were made
of ivory no thicker than a sheet of writing paper.</p>

</div>

<p>It is an old belief that in calm weather it rises from the
bottom of the sea, and, elevating its two broadly-expanded
arms, spreads to the gentle air, as a sail, the membrane,
light as a spider's web, by which they are united; and that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77_b" id="Page_77_b">[Pg 77]</a></span>
seated in its boat-like shell, it thus floats over the smooth
surface of the ocean, steering and paddling with its other
arms. Should storm arise or danger threaten, its masts
and sail are lowered, its oars laid in, and the frail craft,
filling with water, sinks gently beneath the waves.</p>

<p>When and where this picturesque idea originated I am
unable to discover. It dates far back beyond the range
of history; for Aristotle mentions it, and, unfortunately,
sanctioned it. With the weight of his honoured name in
its favour, this fallacy has maintained its place in popular
belief, even to our own times; for the mantle of the great
father of natural history, who was generally so marvellously
correct, fell on none of his successors; Pliny, and &AElig;lian,
and the tribe of compilers who succeeded them, having been
more concerned to make their histories sensational than to
verify their statements.</p>

<p>The very names by which this animal is known to the
science which some persons erroneously think must be so
hard and dry are poetic. In Aristotle's day it was called
the <i>Nautilus</i> or <i>Nauticus</i>, "the mariner," and though two
thousand two hundred years have passed since the great
master wrote, the name still clings to it. As the Pearly
Nautilus, a very different animal, also bears that name,
Gualtieri perceived the necessity of distinguishing the Paper
Nautilus from it, and was followed by Linn&aelig;us, who therefore
entitled the genus to which the latter belongs,
<i>Argonauta</i>, after the ship <i>Argo</i>, in which Jason and his
companions sailed to Colchis to carry off the "Golden
Fleece" suspended there in the temple of Mars, and
guarded by brazen-hoofed bulls, whose nostrils breathed
out fire and death, and by a watchful dragon that never
slept. According to the Greek legend, the <i>Argo</i> was
named after its builder Argus, the son of Danaus, and was
the first ship that ever was built. Oppian ('Halieutics,'
book I.) expresses his opinion that the Nautilus served as
a model for the man who first conceived the idea of constructing
a ship, and embarking on the waters:&mdash;</p>

<p>but the equally enchanting wand of science is able by a
touch to dispel the illusion, and cause the object to appear
in its true proportions. So with the fiction of the "Paper
Sailor."</p>

<p>I have elsewhere described the affinities of the Nautili
and their place in nature, therefore it will only be necessary
for me here to allude to these very briefly, to explain the
great and essential difference that exists between the two
kinds of Nautilus which are popularly regarded as being
one and the same animal.</p>

<p>The <i>Pearly</i> Nautilus (<i>Nautilus pompilius</i>) and the
Argonaut, which from having a fragile shell of somewhat
similar external form is called the <i>Paper</i> Nautilus, both
belong to that great primary group of animals known as
the <i>Mollusca</i>, and to the class of it called the <i>Cephalopoda</i>,
from their having their head in the middle of that which is
the foot in other mollusks. In the Cephalopoda the foot is
split or divided into eight segments in some families, and
in others into ten segments, which radiate from the central
head, like so many rays. These rays are not only used as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81_b" id="Page_81_b">[Pg 81]</a></span>
feet, but, being highly flexible, are adapted for employment
also as prehensile arms, with which their owner captures
its prey, and they are rendered more perfect for this purpose
by being furnished with suckers which hold firmly to any
surface to which they are applied. The Cephalopods
which have the foot divided into ten of these segments or
arms are called the <i>Decapoda</i>, those which have only eight
of them are called the <i>Octopoda</i>. All of these have <i>two</i>
plume-like gills&mdash;one on each side&mdash;and so are called
<i>Dibranchiata</i>; and in the eight-armed section of these is the
argonaut or Paper Nautilus. Of the Pearly Nautilus and
the four-gilled order I shall have more to say by-and-by:
at present we will follow the history of the argonaut.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 28&mdash;THE PAPER NAUTILUS
(Argonauta argo) RETRACTED
WITHIN ITS SHELL.</span>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding all that has
been written of it, it is only
within the last fifty years
that this has been correctly
understood. An eight-armed
cuttle was recognised and named
<i>Ocythoe</i>, which, instead of having,
like the common octopus,
all of its eight arms thong-like
and tapering to a point, had
the two dorsal limbs flattened into a broad thin membrane.
Although this animal was sometimes seen dead
without any covering, it was generally found contained in
a thin and slightly elastic univalve shell of graceful form,
and bearing some resemblance to an elegantly shaped boat.
It did not penetrate to the bottom of this shell; it was not
attached to it by any muscular ligament, nor was the shell
moulded on its body, nor apparently made to fit it. Hence
it was long regarded as doubtful, and even by naturalists so
recent and eminent as Dumeril and De Blainville, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82_b" id="Page_82_b">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the octopod really secreted the shell, or whether, like the
hermit-crab, it borrowed for its protection the shell of some
other mollusk. Aristotle left the subject with the faithful
acknowledgment: "As to the origin and growth of this
shell nothing is yet exactly determined. It appears to be
produced like other shells; but even this is not evident,
any more than it is whether the animal can live without it."
Pliny, as usual, instead of throwing light on the matter,
obscured it. He regarded the shell as the property of a
gasteropod like the snail, and the octopod as an amateur
yachtsman who occasionally went on board and took a trip
in the frail craft, and assisted its owner to navigate it for the
fun of the thing. This is what he says about it<a name="Anchor_76_76" id="Anchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">&nbsp;[76]&nbsp;</a>:
"Mutianus reports that he saw in the Propontis a shell
formed like a little ship, having the poop turned up and
the prow pointed. An animal called the <i>Nauplius</i>, resembling
an octopus, was enclosed in the shell with its
owner, for its amusement in the following manner. When
the sea is calm the guest lowers his arms, and uses them as
oars and a helm, whilst the owner of the shell expands
himself to catch the wind; so that one has the pleasure of
carrying and sailing, and the other of steering. Thus, these
two otherwise senseless animals take their pleasure together;
but the meeting them sailing in their shell is a bad omen
for mariners, and foretells some great calamity."</p>

<p>Although the animal was never found in any other shell, and
the shell was never known to contain any other animal, and
though, when the shell and the animal were found together
they were always of proportionate size, this octopod, as I have
said, was looked upon by some conchologists as a pirate who
had taken possession of a ship which did not belong to him,
until Madame Jeannette Power, a French lady then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83_b" id="Page_83_b">[Pg 83]</a></span>residing in Messina, having succeeded in keeping alive for a
time an argonaut the shell of which had been broken in its
capture, discovered that the animal quickly repaired the
fracture, and reproduced the portions that had been broken
off. Induced by this to make further experiments, she
kept a number of living argonauts in cages sunk in the
sea near the citadel of Messina, and in 1836 laid before
the "Academy" at Catania the following results of her
observations of them:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That the argonaut constructs the shell which it
inhabits.</p>

<p>2nd. That it quits the egg entirely naked, and forms the
shell after its birth.</p>

<p>3rd. That it can repair its shell, if necessary, by a fresh
deposit of material having the same chemical composition
as its original shell.</p>

<p>4th. That this material is secreted by the palmate, or
sail, arms, and is laid on the outside of the shell, to the
exterior of which these membranous arms are closely
applied.</p>

<p>Madame Power was mistaken on two points. Firstly,
the construction of the shell does not commence after the
birth of the animal, but, as has been shown by M.
Duvernoy, its rudimentary form is distinctly visible by the
aid of the microscope in the embryo, whilst still in the
egg; and secondly, she continued to believe in the use of
the membranous arms as sails, and of the others as oars.
This fallacy was exploded by Captain Sander Rang, an
officer of the French navy, and "port-captain" at Algiers,
who carefully followed up Madame Power's experiments,
and confirmed the more important of them. Thus were
set at rest questions which for centuries had divided the
opinions of zoologists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84_b" id="Page_84_b">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Paper Nautilus" is, in fact, a female octopod
provided with a portable nest, in which to carry about and
protect her eggs, instead of brooding over them in some
cranny of a rock, or within the recesses of a pile of shells,
as does her cousin the octopus. From the membranes of
the two flattened and expanded arms she secretes and, if
necessary, repairs her shell, and by applying them closely
to its outer surface on each side, holds herself within it, for
it is not fastened to her body by any attaching muscles.
When disturbed or in danger she can loosen her hold, and,
leaving her cradle, swim away independently of it. It
has been said that, having once left it, she has not the
ability nor perhaps the sagacity to re-enter her nest, and
resume the guardianship of her eggs.<a name="Anchor_77_77" id="Anchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">&nbsp;[77]&nbsp;</a> From my own
observations of the breeding habits of other octopods I
think this most improbable. The use and purpose of the
shell of the argonaut will be better understood if I briefly
describe what I have witnessed of the treatment of its eggs
by its near relative, the octopus.</p>

<p>"The eggs of the octopus," as I have elsewhere said, "when
first laid, are small, oval, translucent granules, resembling
little grains of rice, not quite an eighth of an inch long.
They grow along and around a common stalk, to which
every egg is separately attached, as grapes form part of a
bunch. Each of the elongated bunches is affixed by a
glutinous secretion to the surface of a rock or stone (never
to seaweed, as has been erroneously stated), and hangs
pendent by its stalk in a long white cluster, like a magnified
catkin of the filbert, or, to use Aristotle's simile, like
the fruit of the white alder. The length and number of
these bunches varies according to the size and condition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85_b" id="Page_85_b">[Pg 85]</a></span>the parent. Those produced by a small octopus are
seldom more than about three inches long, and from
twelve to twenty in number; but a full-grown female will
deposit from forty to fifty of such clusters, each about five
inches in length. I have counted the eggs of which these
clusters are composed, and find that there are about a
thousand in each: so that a large octopus produces in one
laying, usually extended over three days, a progeny of from
40,000 to 50,000. I have seen an octopus, when undisturbed,
pass one of her arms beneath the hanging bunches of her
eggs, and, dilating the membrane on each side of it into a
boat-shaped hollow, gather and receive them in it as in a
trough or cradle which exhibited in its general shape and
outline a remarkable similarity to the shell of the argonaut,
with the eggs of which octopod its own are almost identical
in form and appearance. Then she would caress and
gently rub them, occasionally turning towards them the
mouth of her flexible exhalent and locomotor tube, like
the nozzle of a fireman's hose-pipe, so as to direct upon
them a jet of the excurrent water. I believe that the
object of this syringing process is to free the eggs from
parasitic animalcules, and possibly to prevent the growth
of conferva, which, I have found, rapidly overspreads those
removed from her attention."<a name="Anchor_78_78" id="Anchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">&nbsp;[78]&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested that the syringing may be for the
purpose of keeping the water surrounding the eggs well
aerated; but this is evidently erroneous, for the water
ejected from the tube has been previously deprived of its
oxygen, and consequently of its health-giving properties,
whilst passing over the gills of the parent. Week after
week, for fifty days, a brooding octopus will continue to
attend to her eggs with the most watchful and assiduous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86_b" id="Page_86_b">[Pg 86]</a></span>care, seldom leaving them for an instant except to take
food, which, without a brief abandonment of her position,
would be beyond her reach. Aristotle asserted that while
the female is incubating she takes no food. This is
incorrect; but in every case of the kind that has come
under my observation the mother octopod, whenever she
has been obliged to leave her nest, has returned to it as
quickly as possible; and so I believe can, and does, the
female argonaut to her shell, and that, too, without any
difficulty. In her case the numerous clusters of eggs are all
united at their origin to one slender and tapering stalk
which is fixed by a spot of glutinous matter to the body-whorl
of the spiral shell.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 29.&mdash;THE PAPER NAUTILUS (Argonauta argo) CRAWLING.</span>
</div>

<p>This "paper-sailor," then, whom the poets have regarded
as endowed with so much grace and beauty, and living
in luxurious ease, is but a fine lady octopus after all.
Turn her out of her handsome residence, and, instead
of the fairy skimmer of the seas, you have before you an
object apparently as free from loveliness and romance as
her sprawling, uncanny-looking, relative. Instead of floating
in her pleasure boat over the surface of the sea, the
argonaut ordinarily crawls along the bottom, carrying her
shell above her, keel uppermost; and the broad extremities
of the two arms are not hoisted as sails, nor allowed when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87_b" id="Page_87_b">[Pg 87]</a></span>
at rest to dangle over the side of the "boat;" but are used
as a kind of hood by which the animal retains the shell in
its proper position, as a man bearing a load on his shoulders
holds it with his hands. When she comes to the surface,
or progresses by swimming instead of walking, she does so
in the same manner as the octopus: namely, by the forcible
expulsion of water from her funnel-like tube.</p>

<p>But if truth compels us to deprive her of the counterfeit
halo conferred on her by poets, we can award her, on behalf
of science, a far nobler crown; namely, that of the Queen
of the whole great Invertebrate Animal Kingdom. For,
the <i>Cephalopoda</i>, of which the argonaut is a highly
organised member, are not only the highest in their own
division, the <i>Mollusca</i>, but they are as far superior to all
other animals which have no backbones, as man stands
lord and king over all created beings that possess them.</p>

</a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 31.&mdash;SHELL OF THE PAPER NAUTILUS (Argonauta argo).</span>
</div>

<p>Although in outward shape the spiral shell of the Pearly
Nautilus (<i>Nautilus pompilius</i>) somewhat resembles that of
the argonaut, its internal structure is very different. A
section of it shows that it is divided into several chambers,
each of which is partitioned off from the adjoining ones, the
last formed or external one, in which the animal lives, being
much larger than the rest. The object and mode of
construction of these chambers is as follows. As the
animal grows, a constant secretion of new material takes
place on the edge of the shell. By this unceasing process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88_b" id="Page_88_b">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of the addition of new shell in the form of a circular curve
or coil around the older portion, the whole rapidly increases
in size, both in diameter, and in the length of the chamber.
The Nautilus, requiring to keep the secreting portion of its
mantle applied to the lip of the shell, finds the chamber in
which it dwells gradually becoming inconveniently long for
it, and therefore builds up a wall behind itself, and continues
its work of enlarging its premises in front. Each of these
walls, concave in front, towards the mouth of the shell, and
concave behind, acts as a strong girder and support of the
arch of the shell against the inward pressure of deep water:
and it was formerly supposed that each successive chamber
so constructed and vacated remained filled with air, and
<i>thus</i> became an additional float by which the constantly
increasing weight of the growing shell was counter-balanced.
By this beautiful adjustment of augmented floating power to
increased weight, the buoyancy of the shell would be secured
and its specific gravity maintained as nearly as possible equal
to that of the surrounding water. This adjustment does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89_b" id="Page_89_b">[Pg 89]</a></span>
probably take place, but in a somewhat different manner.
As the Nautilus inhabits a depth of from twenty to forty
fathoms, it is evident that the air within its shell would
be displaced by the pressure of such a column of water.<a name="Anchor_79_79" id="Anchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">&nbsp;[79]&nbsp;</a>
Accordingly, in every instance of the capture of a Nautilus
the chambers of its shell have been found filled with water.
It is not improbable that the fluid they contain may be less
compressed, and exert less pressure from within outwards
than that of the external superincumbent column of water,
and that by this unbalanced pressure&mdash;under the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90_b" id="Page_90_b">[Pg 90]</a></span>hydro-dynamic law which governs its mode of self-propulsion
when swimming, and possibly in some degree within the
control of the animal&mdash;the latter is relieved of much of the
weight of its shell. When the Nautilus is at the bottom of
the sea its movement is like that of a snail crawling along
upon the ground with its shell above it. The shell, in
proportion to the size of the animal that inhabits it, is a
heavy one, and unless it were rendered semi-buoyant, its
owner's strength would be severely taxed by the effort to
drag it along. By the means indicated this portable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91_b" id="Page_91_b">[Pg 91]</a></span>
domicile is borne lightly above the body of the Nautilus,
without in any way impeding its progress.</p>

</div>

<p>The chambers are all connected by a membranous tube
slightly coated with nacre, which is connected with a large
sac in the body of the animal, near the heart, and passes
through a circular orifice and a short projecting tube in the
centre of each partition wall, till it ends in the smallest
chamber at the inner extremity of the shell. Dean
Buckland believed this "syphon" to be an hydraulic apparatus
acting as a "fine adjustment" of the specific gravity
of the shell, by admitting water within it when expanded,
and excluding it when contracted. As it contains an
artery and vein near its origin at the mantle, Professor
Owen has regarded it as subservient to the maintenance of
a low vitality in the vacated portion of the shell. Dr.
Henry Woodward is of the opinion that, whilst in the
early life of the Nautilus this siphuncle forms the main
point of attachment between the animal and its shell, it
is in the adult "simply an aborted embryonal organ whose
function is now filled by the shell-muscles, but which in the
more ancient and straight-shelled representatives of the
group (the Orthoceratites) was not merely an embryonal
but an important organ in the adult."</p>

<p>Every one knows the shell of the Pearly Nautilus. It
may be purchased at any shell-shop in a seaside watering-place,
and is imported by hundreds every year from
Singapore.<a name="Anchor_80_80" id="Anchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">&nbsp;[80]&nbsp;</a> It is abundant in the waters of the Indian
Archipelago, especially about the Molucca and Philippine
Islands, and on the shores of New Caledonia and the Fiji
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92_b" id="Page_92_b">[Pg 92]</a></span>and Solomon Islands. It has also been found alive on
Pemba Island, near Zanzibar. It seems strange, therefore,
that until about half a century ago hardly anything was
known of the animal that secretes and inhabits it. Rumphius,
a Dutch naturalist, in his 'Rarities of Amboyna,'
published, in 1705, a description of one with an engraving,
incorrect in drawing, and deficient in detail; and until 1832
this was the only information which existed concerning it.
The great Cuvier never saw one, and being acquainted only
with the two-gilled cephalopods, he regarded the head-footed
mollusks as absolutely isolated from all other
animals in the kingdom of nature, even from the other
classes of the mollusca. It seemed, however, to Professor
Owen, then only nineteen years of age, that in the only
living representative of the four-gilled order, <i>Nautilus
pompilius</i>, might be found the "missing link." When,
therefore, in the year 1824, his fellow-student, Mr. George
Bennett, was about to sail from England to the Polynesian
Islands, young Richard Owen earnestly charged his friend
to do his utmost to obtain, and bring home in alcohol, a
specimen of the much-coveted Pearly Nautilus. The
opportunity did not occur till one warm and calm Monday
evening, the 24th of August, 1829, when a living Nautilus
was seen at the surface of the water not far distant from
the ship, in Marekini Bay, on the south-west coast of the
Island of Erromango, New Hebrides, in the South Pacific
Ocean. It looked like a dead tortoise-shell cat, as the
sailors said. As it began to sink as soon as it was
observed, it was struck at with a boat-hook, and was thus
so much injured that it died shortly after being taken on
board the ship. The shell was destroyed, but the soft
body of the animal was preserved in spirits, and great was
the joy of Mr. Owen when, in July, 1831, Mr. Bennett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93_b" id="Page_93_b">[Pg 93]</a></span>
arrived with it in England, and presented it to the Royal
College of Surgeons. Mr. Owen was then Assistant-Conservator
of the Museum of the College under Mr. Clift,
who was afterwards his father-in-law. He immediately
commenced to anatomise, describe, and figure his rare
acquisition, and in the early part of 1832 published the
result of his work in the form of a masterly treatise, which
proved to be the foundation of his future fame.<a name="Anchor_81_81" id="Anchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">&nbsp;[81]&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Mr. Owen's investigations confirmed his previous supposition
that the Pearly Nautilus is inferior in its organisation
to octopus, sepia, or any other known cephalopod;
that it is not isolated, but that it recedes towards the
gasteropods, to which belong the snail, the periwinkle, &amp;c.,
and that in some of its characters its structure is analogously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94_b" id="Page_94_b">[Pg 94]</a></span>related to the still lower <i>annulosa</i>, or worms. Mr.
Owen was just about to start for Paris with the intention
of presenting a copy of his book to his celebrated contemporary
and friend, and of showing him his dissections of the
Nautilus which had been the subject of his research, when
he heard of Baron Cuvier's death. It must have been to
him a great sorrow and a grievous disappointment.</p>

<p>The Pearly Nautilus, then, is a true cephalopod, in
that it has its foot divided and arranged in segments around
its head, but the form and number of these segments are
very different from those of any other of its class. Instead of
there being eight, as in the argonaut and octopus, or ten, as in
sepia and the calamaries, the Nautilus has about ninety
projecting in every direction from around the mouth. They
are short, round, and tapering, of about the length and thickness
of the fingers of a child. Some of them are retractile
into sheaths, and they are attached to fleshy processes
(which might represent the child's hand), overlying each other,
and covering the mouth on each side. They have none
of the suckers with which the arms and tentacles of all the
other cuttles are furnished, but their annulose structure,
like the rings of an earthworm's body, gives them some
little prehensile power. None of these numerous finger-like
segments of the foot are flattened out like the broad
membranous expansions of the argonaut, and, in fact, the
Nautilus is without any members which can possibly be
regarded as sails to hoist, or as oars with which to row.
It has a strong beak, like the rest of the cuttles; but it has
no ink-sac, for its shell is strong enough to afford it the
protection which its two-gilled relatives have to seek in
concealment.</p>

<p>The Pearly Nautilus usually creeps, like a snail, along
the bed of the sea. It lives at the bottom, and feeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95_b" id="Page_95_b">[Pg 95]</a></span>
at the bottom, principally on crabs; and, as Dr. S. P.
Woodward says, in his 'Manual of the Mollusca,' "perhaps
often lies in wait for them, like some gigantic sea-anemone,
with outspread tentacles." The shape of its shell is not
well adapted for swimming, but it can ascend to the surface,
if it so please, in the same manner as can all the cuttles&mdash;namely,
by the outflow of water from its locomotor tube.
The statement that it visits the surface of the sea of its own
accord is at present, however, unconfirmed by observation.</p>

<p>But, if the Pearly Nautilus is the inferior and poor relation
of the argonaut, it lives in a handsome house, and
comes of an ancient lineage. The Ammonites, whose
beautiful whorled and chambered shells, and the casts of
them, are so abundant in every stratum, especially in the
lias, the chalk, and the oolite, had four gills also. These
Ammonites and the Nautili were amongst the earliest
occupants of the ancient deep; and, with the Hamites,
Turrilites, and others, lived upon our earth during a great
portion of the incalculable period which has elapsed since
it became fitted for animal existence, and in their time
witnessed the rise and fall of many an animal dynasty.
But they are gone now; and only the fossil relics of more
than two thousand species (of which 188 were Nautili)
remain to tell how important a race they were amongst the
inhabitants of the old world seas. They and their congeners
of the chambered shells, however, left one representative
which has lived on through all the changes that have
taken place on the surface of this globe since they became
extinct&mdash;namely, <i>Nautilus pompilius</i>, the Nautilus of the
pearly shell&mdash;the last of the Tetrabranchs.</p>

<p>I need offer no apology for endeavouring to explain the
difference between the Nautilus of the chambered shell and
the argonaut with the membranous arms which it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96_b" id="Page_96_b">[Pg 96]</a></span>
supposed to use as sails, when Webster, in his great standard
dictionary, describes the one and figures the other as
one and the same animal; and when a writer of the celebrity
of Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes also blends the two in
the following poem, containing a sentiment as exquisite as
its science is erroneous. I hope the latter distinguished
and accomplished author, whose delightful writings I enjoy
and highly appreciate, will pardon my criticism. I admit
that the beauty of the thought might well atone for its inaccuracy,
(of which the author is conscious,) were it not that
the latter is made so attractive that truth appears harsh
in disturbing it.</p>

<h2><a name="BARNACLE_GEESE_GOOSE_BARNACLES" id="BARNACLE_GEESE_GOOSE_BARNACLES"></a>BARNACLE GEESE&mdash;GOOSE BARNACLES.</h2>


<p>The belief that some wild geese, instead of being hatched
from eggs, like other birds, grew on trees and rotten
wood has never been surpassed as a specimen of ignorant
credulity and persistent error.</p>

<p>There are two principal versions of this absurd notion.
One is that certain trees, resembling willows, and growing
always close to the sea, produced at the ends of their
branches fruit in form like apples, and each containing
the embryo of a goose, which, when the fruit was ripe, fell
into the water and flew away. The other is that the geese
were bred from a fungus growing on rotten timber floating
at sea, and were first developed in the form of worms in
the substance of the wood.</p>

<p>When and whence this improbable theory had its origin
is uncertain. Aristotle does not mention it, and consequently
Pliny and &AElig;lian were deprived of the pleasure
they would have felt in handing down to posterity, without
investigation or correction, a statement so surprising. It is,
comparatively, a modern myth; although we find that
it was firmly established in the middle of the twelfth
century, for Gerald de Barri, known in literature as
Giraldus Cambrensis, mentions it in his 'Topographia
Hiberni&aelig;,' published in 1187. Giraldus, who was Archdeacon
of Brecknock in the reign of Henry II., and tried hard, more
than once, for the bishopric of St. David's, the functions of
which he had temporarily administered without obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99_b" id="Page_99_b">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the title, was a vigorous and zealous reformer of Church
abuses. Amongst the laxities of discipline against which
he found it necessary to protest was the custom then
prevailing of eating these Barnacle geese during Lent,
under the plea that their flesh was not that of birds, but of
fishes. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"There are here many birds which are called Bernac&aelig;, which
nature produces in a manner contrary to nature, and very wonderful.
They are like marsh-geese but smaller. They are produced from fir-timber
tossed about at sea, and are at first like geese upon it. Afterwards
they hang down by their beaks, as if from a sea-weed attached
to the wood, and are enclosed in shells that they may grow the more
freely. Having thus, in course of time, been clothed with a strong
covering of feathers, they either fall into the water, or seek their liberty
in the air by flight. The embryo geese derive their growth and nutriment
from the moisture of the wood or of the sea, in a secret and most
marvellous manner. I have seen with my own eyes more than a
thousand minute bodies of these birds hanging from one piece of
timber on the shore, enclosed in shells and already formed. Their
eggs are not impregnated <i>in coitu</i>, like those of other birds, nor does
the bird sit upon its eggs to hatch them, and in no corner of the world
have they been known to build a nest. Hence the bishops and clergy
in some parts of Ireland are in the habit of partaking of these birds on
fast days, without scruple. But in doing so they are led into sin.
For, if any one were to eat of the leg of our first parent, although he
(Adam) was not born of flesh, that person could not be adjudged
innocent of eating flesh."</p></blockquote>

<p>This fable of the geese appears, however, to have been
current at least a hundred years before Giraldus wrote, for
Professor Max M&uuml;ller, who treats of it in one of his
"Lectures on the Science of Language," amongst many
interesting references there given, quotes a Cardinal of the
eleventh century, Petrus Damianus, who clearly describes,
that version of it which represents the birds as bursting,
when fully fledged, from fruit resembling apples.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that these Barnacle geese have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100_b" id="Page_100_b">[Pg 100]</a></span>
troubled the priesthood of more than one creed as to the
instructions they should give to the laity concerning the use
of them as food. The Jews&mdash;all those, at least, who
maintain a strict observance of the Hebrew Law&mdash;eat no
meat but that of animals which have been slaughtered in a
certain prescribed manner; and a doubt arose amongst
them at the period we refer to, whether these geese should
be killed as flesh or as fish. Professor Max M&uuml;ller cites
Mordechai,<a name="Anchor_82_82" id="Anchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">&nbsp;[82]&nbsp;</a> as asking whether these birds are fruits, fish,
or flesh; that is, whether they must be killed in the Jewish
way, as if they were flesh. Mordechai describes them as
birds which grow on trees, and says, "the Rabbi Jehuda, of
Worms (who died 1216) used to say that he had heard from
his father, Rabbi Samuel, of Speyer (about 1150), that
Rabbi Jacob Tham, of Ramer&uuml; (who died 1171), the grandson
of the great Rabbi Rashi (about 1140), had decided that
they must be killed as flesh."</p>

<p>Pope Innocent III. took the same view; for at the
Lateran Council, in 1215, he prohibited the eating of
Barnacle geese during Lent. In 1277, Rabbi Izaak, of
Corbeil, determined to be on the safe side, forbade altogether
the eating of these birds by the Jews, "because they were
neither flesh nor fish."</p>

<p>Michael Bernhard Valentine,<a name="Anchor_83_83" id="Anchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">&nbsp;[83]&nbsp;</a> quoting Wormius, says
that this question caused much perplexity and disputation
amongst the doctors of the Sorbonne; but that they passed
an ordinance that these geese should be classed as fishes,
and not as birds; and he adds, that in consequence of this
decision large numbers of these birds were annually sent to
Paris from England and Scotland, for consumption in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101_b" id="Page_101_b">[Pg 101]</a></span>Lent. Sir Robert Sibbald<a name="Anchor_84_84" id="Anchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">&nbsp;[84]&nbsp;</a> refers to this, and says that
Normandy was the locality from which the French capital
was reported to be principally supplied; but that in fact
the greater number of these geese came from Holland.
The date of this edict is not given.</p>

<p>Professor Max M&uuml;ller says that in Brittany, Barnacle
geese are still allowed to be eaten on Fridays, and that the
Roman Catholic Bishop of Ferns may give permission to
people out of his diocese to eat these birds at his table.</p>

<p>In Bombay, also, where fish is prohibited as food to some
classes of the population, the priests call this goose a "sea-vegetable,"
under which name it is allowed to be eaten.</p>

<p>Various localities were mentioned as the breeding-places of
these arboreal geese. Gervasius of Tilbury,<a name="Anchor_85_85" id="Anchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">&nbsp;[85]&nbsp;</a> writing about
1211, describes the process of their generation in full detail,
and says that great numbers of them grew in his time
upon the young willow trees which abounded in the
neighbourhood of the Abbey of Faversham, in the county
of Kent, and within the Archiepiscopate of Canterbury.
The bird was there commonly called the <i>Barneta</i>.</p>

<p>Hector Boethius, or Boece, the old Scottish historian,
combats this version of the story. His work, written in
Latin, in 1527, was translated into quaint Scottish in 1540,
by John Bellenden, Archdeacon of Murray. In his fourteenth
chapter, "Of the nature of claik geis, and of the
syndry maner of thair procreatioun, and of the ile of
Thule," he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Restis now to speik of the geis generit of the see namit clakis.
Sum men belevis that thir clakis growis on treis be the nebbis. Bot
thair opinioun is vane. And becaus the nature and procreatioun of
thir clakis is strange we have maid na lytyll laubore and deligence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102_b" id="Page_102_b">[Pg 102]</a></span>
serche ye treuth and verite yairof, we have salit throw ye seis quhare
thir clakis ar bred, and I fynd be gret experience, that the nature of
the seis is mair relevant caus of thir procreatioun than ony uther
thyng."</p></blockquote>

<p>From the circumstances attending the finding of "ane
gret tree that was brocht be alluvion and flux of the see to
land, in secht of money pepyll besyde the castell of Petslego,
in the yeir of God ane thousand iiii. hundred lxxxx, and of
a see tangle hyngand full of mussill schellis," brought to
him by "Maister Alexander Galloway, person of Kynkell,"
who knowing him to be "richt desirus of sic uncouth
thingis came haistely with the said tangle," he arrives at
the conclusion, by a process of reasoning highly satisfactory
and convincing to himself, that,</p>

<blockquote><p>"Be thir and mony othir resorcis and examplis we can not beleif
that thir clakis ar producit be ony nature of treis or rutis thairof, but
allanerly be the nature of the Oceane see, quhilk is the caus and production
of mony wonderful thingis. And becaus the rude and ignorant
pepyl saw oftymes the fruitis that fel of the treis (quhilkis stude neir
the see) convertit within schort tyme in geis, thai belevit that thir geis
grew apon the treis hingand be thair nebbis sic lik as appillis and
uthir frutis hingis be thair stalkis, bot thair opinioun is nocht to be
sustenit. For als sone as thir appillis or frutis fallis of the tre in the
see flude thay grow first wormeetin. And be schort process of tyme
are alterat in geis."</p></blockquote>

<p>In describing the bird thus produced, Boethius declares
that the male has a sharp, pointed beak, like the gallinaceous
birds, but that in the female the beak is obtuse as
in other geese and ducks.</p>

<p>According to other authors, this wonderful production of
birds from living or dead timber was not confined to
England and Scotland. Vincentius Bellovacensis<a name="Anchor_86_86" id="Anchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">&nbsp;[86]&nbsp;</a> (1190-1264)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103_b" id="Page_103_b">[Pg 103]</a></span>in his 'Speculum Natur&aelig;,' xvii. 40, states that it
took place in Germany, and Jacob de Vitriaco (who
died 1244) mentions its occurrence in certain parts of
Flanders.</p>

<p>Jonas Ramus gives a somewhat different version of the
process as it occurs in Norway. He writes:<a name="Anchor_87_87" id="Anchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">&nbsp;[87]&nbsp;</a> "It is said
that a particular sort of geese is found in Nordland, which
leave their seed on old trees, and stumps and blocks lying
in the sea; and that from that seed there grows a shell fast
to the trees, from which shell, as from an egg, by the heat
of the sun, young geese are hatched, and afterwards grow
up; which gave rise to the fable that geese grow upon
trees."</p>

<p>But, strange to say, if any painstaking enquirer, wishing
to investigate the matter for himself, went to a locality
where it was said the phenomenon regularly occurred, he
was sure to find that he had literally, "started on a wild-goose
chase," and had come to the wrong place. This was
the experience of &AElig;neas Sylvius Piccolomini, afterwards
Pope Pius II., who complained that miracles will always
flee farther and farther away; for when he was on a visit
(about 1430) to King James I., of Scotland,<a name="Anchor_88_88" id="Anchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">&nbsp;[88]&nbsp;</a> and enquired
after the tree which he most eagerly desired to see, he
was told that it grew much farther north, in the Orkney
Islands.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the suspicious fact that the prodigy
receded like Will o' the Wisp, whenever it was persistently
followed up, Sebastian Munster, who relates<a name="Anchor_89_89" id="Anchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">&nbsp;[89]&nbsp;</a> the foregoing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104_b" id="Page_104_b">[Pg 104]</a></span>anecdote of &AElig;neas Sylvius, appears to have entertained no
doubt of the truth of the report, for he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105_b" id="Page_105_b">[Pg 105]</a></span></p><blockquote><p>"In Scotland there are trees which produce fruit, conglomerated of
their leaves; and this fruit, when in due time it falls into the water
beneath it, is endowed with new life, and is converted into a living
bird, which they call the 'tree-goose.' This tree grows in the Island
of Pomonia, which is not far from Scotland, towards the north.
Several old cosmographers, especially Saxo Grammaticus, mention
the tree, and it must not be regarded as fictitious, as some new writers
suppose."</p></blockquote>

<p>Julius C&aelig;sar Scaliger<a name="Anchor_91_91" id="Anchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">&nbsp;[91]&nbsp;</a> (1540) gives another reading of
the legend, in which it is asserted that the leaves which
fall from the tree into the water are converted into fishes,
and those which fall upon the land become birds.</p>

<p>Thus this extraordinary belief held sway, and remained
strong and invincible, although from time to time some
man of sense and independent thought attempted to turn
the tide of popular error. Albertus Magnus (who died 1280)
showed its absurdity, and declared that he had seen the
bird referred to lay its eggs and hatch them in the ordinary
way. Roger Bacon (who died in 1294) also contradicted it,
and Belon, in 1551, treated it with ridicule and contempt.
Olaus Wormius<a name="Anchor_92_92" id="Anchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">&nbsp;[92]&nbsp;</a> seems to have believed in it, though he
wrote cautiously about it. Olaus Magnus (1553) mentions
it, and apparently accepts it as a fact, occurring in the
Orkneys, on the authority of "a Scotch historian who
diligently sets down the secrets of things," and then dismisses
it in three lines.</p>

<p>Passing over many other writers on the subject, we come
to the time of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when (in 1597)
"John Gerarde, Master in Chirurgerie, London," published
his "Herball, or Generall Historie of Plants gathered by
him," and in the last chapter thereof solemnly declared,
that he had actually witnessed the transformation of
"certaine shell fish" into Barnacle Geese, as follows.</p>

vnpolished. There are found in the North parts of Scotland and the
Islands adjacent, called Orchades, certaine trees whereon do grow
certaine shells of a white colour tending to russet, wherein are contained
little liuing creatures: which shells in time of maturity doe open, and
out of them grow those little liuing things, which falling into the water
do become fowles, which we call Barnacles; in the North of England,
brant Geese; and in Lancashire, tree Geese: but the other that do
fall vpon the land perish and come to nothing. Thus much by the
writings of others, and also from the mouthes of people of those parts,
which may very well accord with truth.</p>

<p>But what our eies haue seene, and hands haue touched we shall
declare. There is a small Island in Lancashire, called the Pile of
Foulders, wherein are found the broken pieces of old and bruised ships
some whereof haue beene cast thither by shipwracke, and also the
trunks and bodies with the branches of old and rotten trees, cast vp
there likewise; whereon is found a certaine spume or froth that in
time breedeth vnto certaine shells, in shape like those of the Muskle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107_b" id="Page_107_b">[Pg 107]</a></span>
but sharper pointed, and of a whitish colour; wherein is contained a
thing in forme like a lace of silke finely wouen as it were together, of a
whitish colour, one end whereof is fastened vnto the inside of the shell,
euen as the fish of Oisters and Muskles are: the other end is made
fast vnto the belly of a rude masse or lumpe, which in time commeth to
the shape and forme of a Bird: when it is perfectly formed the shell
gapeth open, and the first thing that appeareth is the foresaid lace or
string; next come the legs of the bird hanging out, and as it groweth
greater it openeth the shell by degrees, til at length it is all come
forth, and hangeth onely by the bill: in short space after it commeth
to full maturitie, and falleth into the sea, where it gathereth feathers,
and groweth to a fowle bigger than a Mallard, and lesser than a
Goose, hauing blacke legs and bill or beake, and feathers blacke and
white, spotted in such manner as is our Magpie, called in some places
a Pie-Annet, which the people of Lancashire call by no other name
than a tree Goose: which place aforesaid, and all those parts adjoyning
do so much abound therewith, that one of the best is bought for
three pence. For the truth hereof, if any doubt, may it please them to
repaire vnto me, and I shall satisfie them by the testimonie of good
witnesses.</p>

<p>Moreover, it should seeme that there is another sort hereof; the
History of which is true, and of mine owne knowledge; for trauelling
vpon the shore of our English coast betweene Douer and Rumney, I
found the trunke of an old rotten tree, which (with some helpe that I
procured by Fishermen's wiues that were there attending their
husbands' returne from the sea) we drew out of the water vpon dry
land; vpon this rotten tree I found growing many thousands of long
crimson bladders, in shape like vnto puddings newly filled, before they
be sodden, which were very cleere and shining; at the nether end
whereof did grow a shell fish, fashioned somewhat like a small Muskle,
but much whiter, resembling a shell fish that groweth vpon the rockes
about Garnsey and Garsey, called a Lympit: many of these shells I
brought with me to London, which after I had opened I found in them
liuing things without forme or shape; in others which were neerer
come to ripenesse I found liuing things that were very naked, in shape
like a Bird: in others, the Birds couered with soft downe, the shell
halfe open, and the Bird ready to fall out, which no doubt were the
Fowles called Barnacles. I dare not absolutely auouch euery circumstance
of the first part of this history, concerning the tree that beareth
those buds aforesaid, but will leaue it to a further consideration; howbeit,
that which I haue seene with mine eies, and handled with mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108_b" id="Page_108_b">[Pg 108]</a></span>
hands, I dare confidently auouch, and boldly put downe for verity.
Now if any will object that this tree which I saw might be one of those
before mentioned, which either by the waues of the sea or some violent
wind had beene ouerturned as many other trees are; or that any trees
falling into those seas about the Orchades, will of themselves bear
the like Fowles, by reason of those seas and waters, these being so
probable conjectures, and likely to be true, I may not without prejudice
gainsay, or endeauour to confute.</p></blockquote>

<p>Gerard was probably a good botanist and herbalist; but
Thomas Johnson, the editor of a subsequent issue of his
book, tells us that</p>

<blockquote><p>"He, out of a propense good will to the publique advancement of
this knowledge, endeavoured to performe therein more than he could
well accomplish, which was partly through want of sufficient learning;
but," he adds, "let none blame him for these defects, seeing he was
neither wanting in pains nor good will to performe what hee intended:
and there are none so simple but know that heavie burthens are with
most paines vndergone by the weakest men; and although there are
many faults in the worke, yet iudge well of the Author; for, as a late
writer well saith:&mdash;'To err and to be deceived is human, and he must
seek solitude who wishes to live only with the perfect.'"</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109_b" id="Page_109_b">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult to comply with the request to think well of
one who, writing as an authority, deliberately promulgated,
with an affectation of piety, that which he must have known
to be untrue, and who was, moreover, a shameless plagiarist;
for Gerard's ponderous book is little more than a translation
of Dodon&aelig;us, whole chapters having been taken
verbatim from that comparatively unread author without
acknowledgment.</p>

<p>After this series of erroneous observations, self-delusion,
and ignorant credulity, it is refreshing to turn to the pages
of the two little thick quarto volumes of Gaspar Schott.<a name="Anchor_93_93" id="Anchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">&nbsp;[93]&nbsp;</a>
This learned Jesuit made himself acquainted with everything
that had been written on the subject, and besides the
authors I have referred to, quotes and compares the statements
of Majolus, Abrahamus Ortelius, Hieronymus Cardanus,
Eusebius, Nierembergius, Deusingius, Odoricus,
Gerhardus de Vera, Ferdinand of Cordova, and many
others. He then gives, firmly and clearly, his own opinion
that the assertion that birds in Britain spring from the
fruit or leaves of trees, or from wood, or from fungus, or
from shells, is without foundation, and that neither reason,
experience, nor authority tend to confirm it. He concedes
that worms may be bred in rotting timber, and even
that they may be of a kind that fly away on arriving at
maturity (referring probably to caterpillars being developed
into moths), but that birds should be thus generated, he
says, is simply the repetition of a vulgar error, for not one
of the authors whom he has examined has seen what they
all affirm; nor are they able to bring forward a single
eye-witness of it. He asks how it can be possible that
animals so large and so highly-organised as these birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110_b" id="Page_110_b">[Pg 110]</a></span>can grow from puny animalcules generated in putrid
wood. He further declares that these British geese are
hatched from eggs like other geese, which he considers
proved by the testimony of Albertus Magnus, Gerhardus
de Vera, and of Dutch seamen, who, in 1569, gave their
written declaration that they had personally seen these
birds sitting on their eggs, and hatching them, on the
coasts of Nova Zembla.</p>

says:&mdash;</p>

shap'd, supposed to be Barnacles. The Shells hung very thick and
close one by another, and were of different sizes. Of the colour and
consistence of Muscle-Shells, and the sides and joynts of them joyned
with such a kind of film as Muscle-Shells are, which serves them for a
Hing to move upon, when they open and shut.... The Shells hang at
the Tree by a Neck longer than the Shell, of a kind of Filmy
substance, round, and hollow, and creased, not unlike the Wind-pipe
of a chicken, spreading out broadest where it is fastened to the Tree,
from which it seems to draw and convey the matter which serves for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112_b" id="Page_112_b">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the growth and vegetation of the Shell and the little Bird within it.
This Bird in every Shell that I opened, as well the least as the biggest,
I found so curiously and compleatly formed, that there appeared
nothing wanting as to internal parts, for making up a perfect Seafowl:
every little part appearing so distinctly that the whole looked
like a large Bird seen through a concave or diminishing glass, colour
and feature being everywhere so clear and neat. The little Bill, like
that of a Goose; the eyes marked; the Head, Neck, Breast, Wings,
Tail, and Feet formed, the Feathers everywhere perfectly shap'd, and
blackish coloured; and the Feet like those of other Water-fowl, to my
best remembrance. All being dead and dry, I did not look after the
internal parts of them. Nor did I ever see any of the little Birds alive,
nor met with anybody that did. Only some credible persons have
assured me they have seen some as big as their fist."</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems almost incredible that little more than two
hundred years ago this twaddle should not only have been
laid before the highest representatives of science in the
land, but that it should have been printed in their "Transactions"
for the further delusion of posterity.</p>

<p>Ray, in his edition of Willughby's Ornithology, published
in the same year as the above, contradicted the fallacy as
strongly as Gaspar Schott; and (except that he incidentally
admits the possibility of spontaneous generation in
some of the lower animals, as insects and frogs) in language
so similar that I think he must have had Schott's work
before him when he wrote.</p>

</div>

<p>Almost every one is acquainted with at least one kind of
the Barnacle shells which were supposed to enclose the
embryo of a goose, namely the small white conical hillocks
which are found, in tens of thousands, adhering to stones,
rocks, and old timber such as the piles of piers, and may
be seen affixed to the shells of oysters and mussels in any
fishmonger's shop. The little animals which secrete and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114_b" id="Page_114_b">[Pg 114]</a></span>inhabit these shells belong to a sub-class and order of the
Crustacea, called the <i>Cirrhopoda</i>, because their feet (<i>poda</i>),
which in the crab and lobster terminate in claws, are
modified into tufts of curled hairs (<i>cirri</i>), or feathers. When
the animal is alive and active under water, a crater may be
seen to open on the summit of the little shelly mountain,
and, as if from the mouth of a miniature volcano, there issue
from this aperture, from between two inner shells, the
<i>cirri</i> in the form of a feathery hand, which clutches at the
water within its reach, and is then quickly retracted within
the shell. During this movement the hair-fringed fingers
have filtered from the water and conveyed towards the
mouth within the shell, for their owner's nutriment, some
minute solid particles or animalcules, and this action of the
casting-net alternately shot forth and retracted continues
for hours incessantly, as the water flows over its resting-place.
The animal can live for a long time out of water,
and in some situations thus passes half its life. Under such
circumstances, the shells, containing a reserve of moisture,
remain firmly closed until the return of the tide brings a fresh
supply of water and food. These are the "acorn-barnacles,"
the <i>balani</i>, commonly known in some localities as "chitters."</p>

<p>Barnacles of another kind are those furnished with a long
stem, or peduncle, which Sir Robert Moray described as
"round, hollow, and creased, and not unlike the wind-pipe
of a chicken." The stem has, in fact, the ringed formation
of the annelids, or worms. The shelly valves are thin, flat,
and in shape somewhat like a mitre. They are composed
of five pieces, two on each side, and one, a kind of rounded
keel along the back of the valves, by which these are united.
The shells are delicately tinted with lavender or pale blue
varied with white, and the edges are frequently of a bright
chrome yellow or orange colour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115_b" id="Page_115_b">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not an uncommon occurrence for a large plank
entirely covered with these "necked barnacles" to be found
floating at sea and brought ashore for exhibition at some
watering-place; and I have more than once sent portions
of such planks to the Aquaria at Brighton, and the Crystal
Palace.</p>

</div>

<p>It is most interesting to watch a dense mass of living
cirripedes so closely packed together that not a speck of
the surface of the wood is left uncovered by them; their
fleshy stalks overhanging each other, and often attached
in clusters to those of some larger individuals; their
plumose casting-nets ever gathering in the food that
comes within their reach, and carrying towards the mouth
any solid particles suitable for their sustenance. How
much of insoluble matter barnacles will eliminate from
the water is shown by the rapidity with which they
will render turbid sea water clear and transparent. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116_b" id="Page_116_b">[Pg 116]</a></span>
most common species of these "necked barnacles" bears
the name of "<i>Lepas anatifera</i>," "the duck-bearing <i>Lepas</i>."
It was so entitled by Linn&aelig;us, in recognition of its having
been connected with the fable, which, of course, met with
no credit from him.</p>

<p>Fig. 39 represents the figure-head of a ship, partly
covered with barnacles, which was picked up about thirty
miles off Lowestoft on the 22nd of October, 1857. It was
described in the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, and the proprietors
of that paper have kindly given me a copy of
the block from which its portrait was printed.</p>

<p>Others of the barnacles affix themselves to the bottoms
of ships, or parasitically upon whales and sharks, and
those of the latter kind often burrow deeply into the skin of
their host. Fig. 40 is a portrait of a <i>Coronula diadema</i> taken
from the nose of a whale stranded at Kintradwell, in the
north of Scotland, in 1866, and sent to the late Mr. Frank
Buckland. Growing on this <i>Coronula</i> are three of the
curious eared barnacles, <i>Conchoderma aurita</i>; the <i>Lepas</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117_b" id="Page_117_b">[Pg 117]</a></span>
<i>aurita</i> of Linn&aelig;us. The species of the whale from which
these Barnacles were taken was not mentioned, but it was
probably the "hunch-backed" whale, <i>Megaptera longimana</i>,
which is generally infested with this <i>Coronula</i>. This very
illustrative specimen was, and I hope still is, in Mr. Buckland's
Museum at South Kensington. It was described by
him in <i>Land and Water</i>, of May 19th, 1866, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118_b" id="Page_118_b">[Pg 118]</a></span>

</div>

<p>The young Barnacle when just extruded from the shell of
its parent is a very different being from that which it will
be in its mature condition. It begins its life in a form
exactly like that of an entomostracous crustacean, and,
like a Cyclops, has one large eye in the middle of its forehead.
In this state it swims freely, and with great activity.
It undergoes three moults, each time altering its figure,
until at the third exuviation it has become enclosed in a
bivalve shell, and has acquired a second eye. It is now
ready to attach itself to its abiding-place; so, selecting its
future residence, it presses itself against the wood, or whatever
the substance may be, pours out from its two antenn&aelig;
a glutinous cement, which hardens in water, and thus fastens
itself by the front of its head, is henceforth a fixture for
life, and assumes the adult form in which most persons
know it best.<a name="Anchor_97_97" id="Anchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">&nbsp;[97]&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary for me to describe more minutely the
anatomy of the Cirripedes; I have said enough to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120_b" id="Page_120_b">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the nature of the plumose appurtenances which, hanging
from the dead shells, were supposed to be the feathers of a
little bird within; but it is difficult to understand how any
one could have seen in the natural occupant of the shell,
"the little bill, like that of a goose, the eyes, head, neck,
breast, wings, tail, and feet, like those of other water-fowl,"
so precisely and categorically detailed by Sir Robert
Moray. As Pontoppidan, who denounced the whole story,
as being "without the least foundation," very truly says,
"One must take the force of imagination to help to make
it look so!"</p>

<p>As to the origin of the myth, I venture to differ entirely
from philologists who attribute it to "language," and "a
similarity of names," for, although, as Professor Max
M&uuml;ller observes in one of his lectures, "words without
definite meanings are at the bottom of nearly all our
philosophical and religious controversies," it certainly is not
applicable in this instance. Every quotation here given
shows that the mistake arose from the supposed resemblance
of the plumes of the cirrhopod, and the feathers of
a bird, and the fallacious deductions derived therefrom.
The statements of Maier (p. 112), Gerard (p. 106), Sir Robert
Moray (p. 110), &amp;c., prove that this fanciful misconception
sprang from erroneous observation. The love of the marvellous
inherent in mankind, and especially prevalent in times
of ignorance and superstition, favoured its reception and
adoption, and I believe that it would have been as widely
circulated, and have met with equal credence, if the names
of the cirripede and of the goose that was supposed to be
its offspring had been far more dissimilar than, at first, they
really were.</p>

<p>Setting aside several ingenious and far-fetched derivations
that have been proposed, I think we may safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121_b" id="Page_121_b">[Pg 121]</a></span>
regard the word "barnacle," as applied to the cirrhopod,
as a corruption of <i>pernacula</i>, the diminutive of <i>perna</i>, a
bivalve mollusk, so-called from the similarity in shape of
its shell to that of a ham&mdash;<i>pernacula</i> being changed to
<i>bernacula</i>. In some old Glossaries <i>perna</i> is actually spelt
<i>berna</i>.</p>

<p>To arrive at the origin of the word "barnacle," or
"bernicle," as applied to the goose, we must understand
that this bird, <i>Anser leucopsis</i>, was formerly called the
"brent," "brant," or "bran" goose, and was supposed to
be identical with the species, <i>Anser torquatus</i>, which is now
known by that name. The Scottish word for "goose" is
"clake," or "clakis,"<a name="Anchor_98_98" id="Anchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">&nbsp;[98]&nbsp;</a> and I think that the suggestion
made long ago to Gesner<a name="Anchor_99_99" id="Anchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">&nbsp;[99]&nbsp;</a> (1558), by his correspondent,
Joannes Caius, is correct, that the word "barnacle" comes
from "branclakis," or "barnclake," "the dark-coloured
goose."</p>

<p>Professor Max M&uuml;ller is of the opinion that its Latin
name may have been derived from <i>Hibernic&aelig;</i>, <i>Hibernicul&aelig;</i>,
<i>Bernicul&aelig;</i>, as it was against the Irish bishops that Geraldus
wrote, but I must say that this does not commend itself to
me; for the name <i>Bernicula</i> was not used in the early times
to denote these birds. Giraldus himself described them as
<i>Bernac&aelig;</i>, but they were variously known, also, as <i>Barliates</i>,
<i>Bernestas</i>, <i>Barnetas</i>, <i>Barbates</i>, etc.</p>

<p>I agree with Dr. John Hill,<a name="Anchor_100_100" id="Anchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">&nbsp;[100]&nbsp;</a> that "the whole matter that
gave origin to the story is that the 'shell-fish' (cirripedes),
supposed to have this wonderful production usually adhere
to old wood, and that they have a kind of fibres hanging
out of them, which, in some degree, resemble feathers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122_b" id="Page_122_b">[Pg 122]</a></span>some bird. From this slight origin arose the story that
they contained real birds: what grew on trees people soon
asserted to be the fruit of trees, and, from step to step, the
story gained credit with the hearers," till, at length, Gerard

<p>The Barnacle Goose is only a winter visitor of Great
Britain. It breeds in the far north, in Greenland, Iceland,
Spitzbergen, and Nova Zembla, and probably, also, along
the shores of the White Sea. There are generally some
specimens of this prettily-marked goose in the gardens of
the Zoological Society in the Regent's Park, London; and
they thrive there, and become very tame. In the months
of December and January these geese may often be seen
hanging for sale in poulterers' shops; and he who has tasted
one well cooked may be pardoned if the suspicion cross
his mind that the "monks of old," and "the bare-footed
friars," as well as the laity, may not have been unwilling to
sustain the fiction in order that they might conserve the
privilege of having on their tables during the long fast of
Lent so agreeable and succulent a "vegetable" or "fish"
as a Barnacle Goose.</p>

of the <i>Osborne</i>, the paddles were <i>supposed</i>, not <i>seen</i>, and were invented
to account for an animal of great length progressing at the surface of
the water at the rate of twelve to fifteen miles an hour without its being
possible to perceive, upon the closest and most attentive inspection,
any undulatory movement to which its rapid advance could be
ascribed. As the great calamaries were unknown, their mode of swift
retrograde motion, by means of an outflowing current of water, was
of course unsuspected.</p></div>

Annals of Philosophy, 1825: "There is every reason to believe from
general structure that there exists an affinity between the tortoises and
the snakes; but the genus that exactly unites them is at present
unknown to European naturalists; which is not astonishing when we
consider the immense number of undescribed animals which are daily
occurring. If I may be allowed to speculate from the peculiarities of
structure which I have observed, I am inclined to think that the union
will most probably take place by some newly discovered genera allied
to the marine or fluviatile soft-skinned turtles and the marine serpent."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p></div>

contains an allusion to the rising and setting of the sun, and that his
semi-piscine form was the expression of the idea that half his time was
spent above ground, and half below the waves. The same commentators
also regard all the "civilizing" gods and goddesses as, respectively,
solar and lunar deities. The attributes symbolized in the
worship of Noah and the sun are so nearly alike that the two interpretations
are not incompatible.</p></div>

by the early Christians, and was frequently sculptured on their tombs
as a private mark or sign of the faith in which the person there
interred had died. It alluded to the letters which composed the
Greek word [Greek: Ichthys] ("a fish") forming an anagram, the initials
of words which conveyed the following sentiment: [Greek: I&ecirc;sous], Jesus;
[Greek: Christos], Christ; [Greek: Theou], of God; [Greek: gios], Son; [Greek: S&ocirc;t&ecirc;r], Saviour. But it
doubtless bore, also, the older meaning of "preservation" and "reproduction,"
of which the fish was the symbol, and betokened a belief
in a future resurrection, as Noah was preserved to dwell in, and
populate, a new world. In 'Sea Monsters Unmasked,' <a href="#Page_55">page 55</a>,
I gave a figure, copied by permission from the <i>Illustrated London
News</i>, of a rough sculpture in the Roman catacombs, of Jonah being
disgorged by a sea-monster. Near to it was found, on another Christian
tomb, one of these designs of the "fish;" and it is not a little
curious that, whereas the animal depicted as casting forth Jonah is
not a whale, but a sea-serpent, or dragon, the <i>ichtheus</i> in this instance
is apparently not a fish, but a seal.

work of our greatest men, and of the tide in their affairs, which,
taken at the flood, led on to fortune, that I hope I may be excused for
referring to the period when the distinguished chief of the Natural
History Department of the British Museum, the great comparative
anatomist, the unrivalled pal&aelig;ontologist, the illustrious physiologist,
the venerable and venerated friend of all earnest students, was beginning
to attract the attention, and to receive the approbation of his
seniors as a promising young worker. In Messrs. Griffith and Pidgeon's
Supplement to Cuvier's 'Mollusca and Radiata,' published in 1834, the
treatise in question is thus mentioned: "We have much pleasure in referring
to a most excellent memoir on <i>Nautilus pompilius</i>, by Mr. Owen,
with elaborate figures of the animal, its shell, and various parts, published
by direction of the Council of the College of Surgeons. The
reader will find the most satisfactory information on the subject, and
the scientific public will earnestly hope that the present volume will be
the first of a similar series." This hope has been more than fulfilled.
Dean Buckland, in his 'Bridgewater Treatise,' wrote of this work: "I
rejoice in the present opportunity of bearing testimony to the value of
Professor Owen's highly philosophical and most admirable memoir&mdash;a
work not less creditable to the author than honourable to the Royal
College of Surgeons, under whose auspices the publication has been so
handsomely conducted."</p></div>

barnacles they may easily do so. The method I have generally
adopted has been as follows: Procure a shallow glass or earthenware
milk-pan that will hold at least a gallon. Fill this to within an inch
of the top with sea-water, and place it in any shaded part of a room&mdash;not
in front of a window. Put in the pan six or eight pebbles or clean
shells of equal height, say 1&frac12; or 2 inches, and on them lay a clean
sheet of glass, which, by resting on the pebbles, is brought to within
about 2&frac12; inches of the surface of the water. Select some limpets or
mussels having acorn-barnacles on them; carefully cut out the limpet
or mussel, and clean nicely the interior of the shell; then place a
dozen or more of these shells on the sheet of glass, and the barnacles
upon them will be within convenient reach of any observation with
a magnifying glass. If this be done in the month of March, the experimenter
will not have to wait long before he sees young <i>Balani</i>
ejected from the summits of some of the shells. Up to the moment of
their birth each of them is enclosed in a little cocoon or case, in shape
like a canary-seed, and most of them are tossed into the world whilst
still enclosed in this. In a few seconds this casing is ruptured longitudinally,
apparently by the struggles of its inmate, which escapes at
one end, like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, and swims freely
to the surface of the water, leaving the split cocoon or case at the
bottom of the pan. Some few of the young barnacles seem to be
freed from the cocoon before, or at the moment of, extrusion. From
three to a dozen or more of these escape with each protrusion of the
cirri of the parent, and as the parturient barnacle will put forth its
feathery casting net at least twenty times in a minute for an hour or
more, it follows that as many as ten thousand young ones may be produced
in an hour. These, as they are cast forth at each pulsation of
the parent's cirri, fall upon the clean sheet of glass, and may be taken
up in a pipette, and placed under a microscope, or removed to a
smaller vessel of sea-water, for minute and separate investigation. It
seems strange that animals which, like the oyster and the barnacles,
are condemned in their mature condition to lead so sedentary a life,
should in the earlier stages of their existence swim freely and merrily
through the water&mdash;young fellows seeking a home, and when they
have found it, although their connubial life must be a very tame one,
settling down, and not caring to rove about any more for the remainder
of their days. These young <i>Balani</i> dart about like so many water-fleas,
and yet, after a few days of freedom, they become fixed and immovable,
the inhabitants of the pyramidal shells which grow in such
abundance on other shells, stones, and old wood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119_b" id="Page_119_b">[Pg 119]</a></span></p></div>

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
